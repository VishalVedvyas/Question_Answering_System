"New Delhi: RelianceNSE -0.27 % Jio Infocomm Ltd grabbed the leadership position in terms of revenue market share in the third quarter of the current fiscal, racing past Vodafone Idea and Bharti AirtelNSE -1.27 %.It is set to top the sector in the next few quarters, said a report from the brokerage house JM Financials. Based on Q3 results, the reported mobile revenues of Vodafone Idea, Reliance Jio and Airtel were Rs 11,000 crore, Rs 10,400 crore and Rs 10,100 crore, respectively, implying a revenue market share of 31.6 per cent, 29.9 per cent and 29 per cent, respectively, the report said. Since Jio does not report interconnect revenues (on incoming calls) in its top line, the report states that on a like-for-like basis, the Mukesh Ambani-owned company's mobile revenues were around Rs 11,200 crore (including interconnect revenues), the highest in the market in the September-December quarter, with an underlying revenue market share (RMS) of 31.6 per cent, ahead of Vodafone Idea's 30.8 per cent, said the report. ""However, unlike other telcos, Jio does not report interconnect revenues in its top line, instead netting them off in interconnect costs. Thus, on a like-for-like basis, Jio's Q3 RMS was 31.6 per cent, ahead of even Vodafone Idea,"" the report stated. JM Financials said the reported mobile revenues overstate the (pre-tax) consumer spending, as they include interconnect (inter-operator) flows. Jio has achieved the RMS leadership in the mobile market in the sixth quarter since the launch of commercial 4G services, it said.On reported mobile revenue basis, Jio went past Bharti Airtel in the third quarter to become number two in India with revenues of Rs 10,380 crore (reported RMS of 29.9 per cent). Circle wise, Jio has over 30 per cent RMS in 16 circles and is the market leader in four of them -- Madhya Pradesh, Rajastan, Assam and Orissa. Based on the Q3 gross revenue data, Jio's all-India RMS was 30 per cent, marginally below Airtel's 31.3 per cent and Vodafone Idea's 32.3 per cent. Jio's RMS gains have come mainly at the expense of Vodafone IdeaNSE -1.23 % and and smaller telcos, the report noted. As for the incumbents, Vodafone Idea has seen maximum RMS erosion in A and B circles. It has been able to largely hold on to RMS leadership in the Metro category. But in the C category, Vodafone Idea is now a distant number three after Airtel and Jio, the report said.Vodafone Idea's RMS continues to be over 50 per cent in Kerala, but is likely to drop over the next few quarters. Its top two circles by gross revenues were Maharashtra (46 per cent RMS) and Gujarat (45 per cent RMS). As per Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's (TRAI) third quarter report, the total wireless gross revenues was up 3.6 per cent quarter on quarter while adjusted gross revenue was up 2.3 per cent. ""We estimate that aggregate wireless revenue was up 1.1 per cent QoQ, driven by 12 per cent growth reported by Jio. Airtel's mobile revenues were flat, while Vodafone Idea's declined by 0.3 per cent. Wireless revenue continues to be below 0.75 per cent of nominal GDP in India, well below the level for peers like China (1.1 per cent) and Indonesia (1.3 per cent),"" the report stated. According to JM Financials, the underlying wireless spending before taxes (AGR less non-wireless revenues) was up 1.3 per cent, estimated at Rs 31,100 crore in the Q3 against Rs 30,700 crore in the preceding quarter. ""Assuming that there would be no fresh tariff cuts, mobile spending should continue to rise in our view, driven by subscribers upgrading from feature phones to smartphones, adoption of unlimited voice plans, minimum average revenue per user plans for feature phone users and the Jio phone exchange offer,"" the report said."
"Bengaluru: In its bid to check online distribution of pirated content, the draft ecommerce policy has proposed to set up a body of industry stakeholders to identify websites that host infringing matter and curtail their advertising and subscription revenue. Online distribution of pirated content is a cause for serious concern, the government said in the draft policy. A Ficci and EY study in March 2018 estimated that the film industry alone loses $2.8 billion in revenue to online piracy.The draft said such “rogue” websites will be included in the Infringing Websites List (IWL) after verification. ET had on February 6 reported that the Indian film and music industry was teaming up with advertisers to form a voluntary code aimed at reducing ad-supported illegal content. The Cell for IPR Promotion and Management (CIPAM), a unit of the commerce ministry’s Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), is spearheading the effort.The draft policy said that internet service providers should remove or disable access to websites included in IWL within set timelines, payment gateways should not permit flow of money to or from those sites, search engines should remove those sites from their search results, and advertisers or agencies should not host any advertisements on them.  It added that intermediaries need to identify “trusted entities”, whose complaints are resolved on priority. The identification of trusted entity and antipiracy measures shall be done on a voluntary basis, it said.If the owner of a copyrightprotected work accuses any website or ecommerce platform of making available such work, then the site or the platform should remove or disable access to such content, the draft said."
"KOLKATA: Vodafone IdeaNSE -1.23 % (VIL) and Bharti Airtel’s mobile service revenue in India likely grew sequentially for the first time in 11 quarters in the three months ended March, driven by minimum recharge plans and as more users opted for higher-priced voice and data packs, analysts Vodafone Idea, Bharti AirtelNSE -1.27 %, Reliance Jio Infocomm, price war, minimum recharge planssaid.Reliance Jio Infocomm, which disrupted the sector when it started in September 2016, though, is likely to continue to outclass both its rivals, posting strong net profit and revenue growth, propelled by heavy customer addition. The price war triggered by Jio’s entry appears to be winding down, possibly signalling the return of stability in the sector.“Growth is set to return for Airtel and VIL as tariffs have largely stabilised,” brokerage BNP Paribas said in a note seen by ET. It said the introduction of minimum recharge plans — to keep services active — will likely be revenue accretive and result in improved monetisation.Bank of America-Merrill Lynch estimates Airtel’s India mobile revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter will increase 4% over the previous three months, while BNP predicts VIL’s mobile revenue will grow 1%.AIRTEL MAY POST FIRST LOSS IN ALMOST 16 YEARSJio’s entry with free voice calls and dirt-cheap data had forced operators to match tariffs to protect their user base, which hurt their revenue and earnings. Consequently, smaller telcos shut down and Vodafone India merged with Idea Cellular, reducing the field to three private operators — Jio, Airtel and VIL.Analysts now say the worst appears to be over.Bank of America-Merrill Lynch expects Airtel’s average revenue per user (ARPU) — a key performance metric — to jump over 21% to Rs 126. BNP estimates VIL’s ARPU will increase 19% to Rs 106. Both telcos introduced their minimum recharge plans in October, aiming to weed out non-revenue generating customers and boost ARPU.BNP expects Airtel and VIL to have each added 9-10 million mobile broadband users in the quarter. It said VIL’s data volume growth is poised to accelerate, driven by the speedy integration of networks following the merger.The brokerages said Mukesh Ambani-led Jio will likely report its sixth successive quarterly profit as Airtel and VIL continue to make losses for their India mobile businesses. BofAML said Jio’s net profit would jump 64% on-year to Rs 840 crore, boosted by the net addition of an estimated 29.5 million users.The US brokerage estimates Jio’s revenue would grow 57% on-year and 8% sequentially to Rs 11,210 crore, although monthly ARPU could dip 2% on-quarter to Rs 127, marginally ahead of Airtel’s.Airtel is expected to report a net consolidated loss in the range of Rs 599 crore to Rs 1,300 crore — its first in almost 16 years — with still-low pricing, higher costs and its non-mobile businesses shrinking.CLSA estimates Airtel’s home broadband and DTH business will “see 3% on-quarter revenue declines” due to competition and a new regulatory order that allows consumers to select and pay only for channels they want to watch.The wide variation in Airtel’s loss estimates is due to the possibility of the telco being stung by higher depreciation and finance charges, said analysts.The nation’s second-largest telco had eked out a Rs 86-crore net profit in the fiscal third quarter, helped by one-time gains. During that quarter, its India mobile service revenue had slipped below Jio’s for the first time and also posted a loss.For January-March, Airtel’s India mobile service revenue — estimated at Rs 10,289-10,342 crore — will yet again be below Jio’s. Consolidated revenue is expected to be in the range of Rs 20,506-20,930 crore. Airtel also offers mobile services in 15 African countries.Analysts at BNP predict a 1% sequential rise in VIL’s revenue to Rs 11,882.4 crore.They expect VIL and Airtel’s upcoming rights issues of Rs 25,000 crore each to be fully subscribed “in view of promoter commitment and discount being offered”, which would alleviate debt concerns."
"Healthcare technology firm CitiusTech is looking to more than double its revenue to $ 500 million in five years on the back of growing investments by hospitals, insurance firms and service providers in the US and Europe in harnessing data to improve servicesNSE 0.05 %. The firm expects to close this fiscal with revenues of $175-180 million, including income from FluidEdge, which it acquired earlier this year. “We have been growing at 25% annually over the last few years, so even if we continue to grow at this rate, we would reach our goal of becoming a $500 million company in five years,” said CitiusTech CEO Rizwan Koita. The company has just set up an advisory board comprising veterans from the healthcare industry to offer strategic guidance to the management to drive innovation across key markets. CitiusTech caters to four main market segments; healthcare providers, payers, medical technology and services companies, and life science organizations. It primarily operates in the areas of enterprise applications, data management, performance management and data science and consulting. Koita said the firm would continue to look for acquisition opportunities in these domains to try and grow faster. “We’ve identified three broad areas for our M&A focus, acquiring complementary skill sets in the US market, health tech companies in Europe, particularly in the UK and Germany and Indian firms working on capabilities and solutions relevant to our clients in this space,” said Koita. Koita was previously the founder and CEO of Transworks BPO and set up Citius-Tech in 2005 with Jagdish Moorjani. Currently, the US is the biggest market for the company, contributing 90% to total revenues, but Koita said that the international business was starting to gain traction and would soon comprise 20% of the revenue, through both organic and inorganic growth. In terms of business segments, enterprise applications has traditionally been the biggest, with data management and data science also starting to record rapid growth given the impact these have in improving care delivery, he said. There are a few broad themes at play impacting the growth of the healthcare technology segment. The biggest is how software is being deployed and the transition to the cloud, along with the use of data and analytics to improve how healthcare services are delivered and managed."
"New Delhi: RelianceNSE -0.27 % Jio Infocomm toppled Vodafone Idea to become the largest telco by access services revenue, underlining growth of the new entrant in contrast to pressure on older operators, including Bharti AirtelNSE -1.27 %, that saw a fall in numbers, according to the regulator’s data for the quarter ended September.Jio saw its adjusted gross revenue (AGR) from access services, or revenue derived from licensed services, rise over 16% on-quarter to Rs 8,271 crore at end of September, according to data released by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on Tuesday.In comparison, Vodafone Idea, the largest telco by subscribers, saw a fall of 8.5% in access services revenue to Rs 7,528 crore, while Bharti Airtel slipped 1.31% to Rs 6,720 crore.The telecom industry’s AGR shrank 1.12% to Rs 36,142 crore. Access services contributed 71.18% of total AGR of telecom services.However, Jio continues to be the third-largest based on subscribers. Despite adding the highest subscribers — at 37 million — in the quarter, Jio had a subscriber market share of 21.57%. Vodafone Idea continued to be market leader in this segment, with a 37.20% market share, while Bharti Airtel was the second largest with 29.38% market share.Industry experts say this implies Jio has subscribers who, on average, contribute more to topline than its rivals, a key reason why Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel have introduced minimum recharge plans that force dormant subscribers to do a minimum monthly recharge, potentially pushing up ARPUs.The Mukesh Ambani-owned telco continues to exert pricing pressure on the industry, which is desperate to see rounds of tariff hikes for revenue recovery and a return to profitability, early signs of which are visible, say analysts. Licence fee for July-September declined 1.35% sequentially to Rs 2,889 crore, while spectrum usage charge (SUC) increased by 1.51% to Rs 1,043 crore. These two components are paid by the telecom companies to the government basis their AGR.Trai also said blended average revenue per user (ARPU) per month declined to Rs 67 in the September quarter, from Rs 69 in the June quarter, due to pressure on rates.The low rates led to higher consumption of services with the all India average of minutes of usage (MOU) per subscriber per month increasing from 607 in the June quarter to 627 in the September quarter, showing a 3.29% growth.Jio also had most internet subscribers, at 252 million, recording a 45.04% market share during the quarter. Vodafone Idea was the second largest internet service provider, with 140 million subscribers, while Bharti Airtel was third, with 126 million subscribers at Septemberend. Vodafone Idea had a 25% market share while Airtel had 22.67%."
"State-owned telecom firm BSNL has collected a record revenue of Rs 6,500 crore from enterprise segment, making it sufficiently funded, which will help in meeting its various requirement. ""We have collected Rs 6,500 crore from enterprise segment for 2018-19. This is highest ever that BSNL has collected with 91,000 enterprise making payment. On average, annual collection used to be from 50,000-60,000 enterprises,"" BSNL CMD Anupam Shrivastava told . When asked if this will help BSNL to make salary payments, he said that financially, the company is in comfortable position and it has seen revenue stabilising in other segments as well. ""Even in consumer and mobility segment revenue has stabilised and we have seen slightly increase in it. Worst is behind us. We are looking for revival only. In my five years, I have realised that BSNL has so much with it that this organisation should never face problem,"" Shrivastava said. BSNL has been ailing because of high revenue-to-wage ratio as a large number of government employees were transferred by the telecom department to the telecom PSU. ""We are sitting on gold mine. Department of Public Enterprise has declared that BSNL has networth of Rs 83,000 crore which is humongous. If we start working on asset monetisation, we will be able to resolve most of our issues,"" Shrivastava said. Despite being a loss-making telecom firm, BSNL has the lowest debt of Rs 14,000 crore among all telecom operators. The company has been operating in the highly competitive telecom market without having spectrum for 4G servicesNSE 0.05 %. It is the only incumbent operator that has been adding new subscribers every month while others have lost millions in last few months. It has sought 4G spectrum across India through equity infusion of Rs 7,000 crore. The total spectrum will cost the firm Rs 14,000 crore."
"Gurugram-based digital payments company Mobikwik has doubled its revenue to Rs 85.6 crore in 2018 against Rs 44.3 crore in 2017, even though losses piled up 51 per cent to Rs 200 crore against Rs 132 crore in the same period, as per filings with the corporate affairs ministry and sourced from business intelligence firm Tofler.The company, which competes with the likes of Paytm and PhonePe, has been facing tremendous competition from its rivals in the payments space. Therefore it has made an effort to move on to become a broader fintech player by entering lending and investments as well.“By end of financial year 2019, we are on-track to double our revenues of 2017–18 and halve our losses. October onwards, we became positive on contribution margin, a milestone that no other fintech platform of reasonable scale in India has been able to reach. We believe our new efforts in 2018 will lead to our first profitable year at significant scale,” wrote Bipin Preet Singh, chief executive officer, Mobikwik in a blog post recently.Further the company also made disclosures that its co-founders Singh and Upasana Taku earned Rs 2.15 crore each during the reported year.2018 has also been a very critical year for Mobikwik having made its first acquisition in the fintech space. The company acquired Mumbai-based investment platform Clearfunds. Singh wrote in the blog post that the aim of the company now is to disrupt the two major under penetrated markets, lending and wealth management.Mobikwik, which was founded way back in 2009, is backed by marquee investors like Sequoia Capital, American Express and even counts Bajaj Finance as one of its strategic backers. It was one of the last standalone payment entities till it entered other services as well, since Paytm became a bank, Freecharge was absorbed by Axis Bank and Citrus Payments got bought by PayU."
"KOLKATA: The government’s revenue mop-up from the telecom industry fell by nearly 22% in FY18 due to a decline in service providers earnings from sale of services, amid a brutal tariff war, telecom minister Manoj Sinha told Rajya Sabha on Friday.Sinha said the industry’s adjusted gross revenue (AGR) fell 18.62% to Rs 1,30,844.9 crore in FY18 from Rs 1,60,787.9 crore in the previous fiscal, resulting in lower licence fees and spectrum usage charges (SUC), reflecting continuing financial stress.AGR is the revenue that telcos derive from access services. They pay 8% of AGR as licence fee and roughly 5% as SUC — the two key revenue streams for the government. Revenue from licence fee declined 18.12 % to Rs 10,670.6 crore in FY18, from Rs 13,032.9 crore in FY17. “SUC receipts have also declined due to declining AGR,” Sinha said in a written reply to a query in the House.SUC dipped over 29% to Rs 4,983.75 crore in FY18, from Rs 7,048 crore in the FY17, the minister said.Sinha also cited the earlier report of an inter-ministerial group (IMG) on stressed assets in the telecom sector, which had noted, “Increased competition in the sector and entry of a new operator (read: Reliance Jio) led to free promotional offers, triggering a downward trend of tariffs and consequent decline in revenues.”Jio’s disruptive entry in September 2016 and its relentless pricing aggression had forced older incumbent carriers to match rates to hold on to customers, in turn, eroding their revenue and profits.That led to big-ticket consolidation, culminating in the mega Vodafone-Idea merger last August, as well as exits of several fringe players who could not withstand the brutal price wars. In this context, Sinha said “the IMG had noted financial stress for some operators had been caused by low operating cash flows over a number of years, inadequate equity infusion and debt that does not appear sustainable.”However, the minister said the IMG report also noted the entire sector was not in financial stress, and accordingly, the primary solutions to current problems would have to come internally from the telcos as they remained liable to service debt taken by them.Sinha’s comments in Parliament come less than two months after the embattled Vodafone Idea (VIL) under intense financial pressure, having posted a whopping Rs 4,974-crore loss in the September quarter, had raised concerns about its ability to service debt that has ballooned to over Rs 1.15 lakh crore.Vodafone Idea chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla recently met top finance ministry officials, flagging off the company’s woes and warning of a default on spectrum related payments which fall due in March 2019.PENALTY OF Rs 58 LAKHSeparately, the telecom minister said the government has initiated steps to rein call drops by slapping a penalty of Rs 58 lakh on telcos, including erstwhile Idea CellularNSE -1.23 % (which merged with Vodafone India in August 2018) and staterun Bharat Sanchar Nigam.“A penalty of Rs 4 lakh was imposed on BSNL in the June quarter while Rs 12 lakh was slapped on Idea during the same quarter,” the minister said.Elaborating on financial disincentives imposed by the regulator on non-complaint providers against prescribed call drop benchmarks, Sinha said during the March quarter, a Rs 3-lakh penalty was imposed on BSNL, Rs 10.5 lakh on Idea, Rs 22.5 lakh on Tata TeleservicesNSE 1.64 % and Rs 6 lakh on erstwhile Telenor India (which was acquired by Bharti AirtelNSE -1.27 % last May).However, the minister added that the call drops situation had improved with augmentation of telecommunications infrastructure and an increase in the base stations count to 20 lakh from 8 lakh in calender 2014."
"KOLKATA: Cable TV Equipments Traders and Manufacturers Association (CTMA) Wednesday stressed that TRAI should re-look the revenue share distribution between broadcasters and local cable operators to incentivise them to upgrade and improve the delivery mechanism.""TRAI should re-look the revenue share distribution between broadcasters and local cable operators,"" CTMA secretary, K K Binani said.He also informed that Android set-top box (STB) that will convert ordinary TV sets to SMART TV is the latest attraction.""West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is very serious about the Cable TV sector and has formed a high-powered committee to look into the problems of 25,000 cable operators and over one lakh others engaged in earning their livelihood from this sector,"" Kolkata Mayor and West Bengal Urban Development minister Firhad Hakim was quoted as saying in a CTMA statement.A three-day Cable TV show is being held here from January 9 and 11."
"KOLKATA: China’s BBK Electronics Corp. may have strengthened its position as number two smartphone maker by revenue in the Indian market in the year ended March, riding on sales of its two largest brands Oppo and Vivo, four years after their entry.As per the latest regulatory filings of Oppo and Vivo with the Registrar of Companies (RoC), the combined India revenue of these two brands owned by BBK Electronics was Rs 23,173 crore in FY18. In contrast with that, India’s largest mobile phone maker by revenue, Samsung, posted FY17 sales of Rs 34,261crore.CHANGE IN STRATEGYLenovo India’s revenue in FY17 was Rs 11,950 crore driven by the Motorola and Lenovo brands, Apple’s was Rs 11,704 crore and Xiaomi posted Rs 8,379.33 crore. The FY18 revenue of these firms is not yet available with RoC.Sales of BBK brand phones added up to Rs 14,343 crore in FY17 when it became the second-largest maker with Apple and Lenovo closely following behind. Since then, both Apple and Lenovo-Motorola have lost ground in volume market share as per market trackers. Analysts said BBK’s FY18 position is likely to improve even further since One-Plus numbers are yet to be added. Also owned by BBK, OnePlus hasn’t declared India revenue yet.OnePlus emerged as the largest brand in the premium segment overtaking Apple and Samsung in the April-June quarter as per tracker Counterpoint Research. Both Oppo and Vivo crossed the Rs 10,000-crore sales milestone in the Indian market in FY18, as per RoC filings. Oppo Mobiles India’s gross revenue in rose 49% to Rs 11,994.3 crore, while that of Vivo Mobile India surged 78% to Rs 11,179.3 crore.However, Samsung, Xiaomi and Apple are profitable in India whereas the losses of Oppo and Vivo are swelling. Oppo’s net loss last fiscal increased to Rs 357.8 crore from Rs 41.9 crore in FY17, while that of Vivo rose to Rs 120.4 crore from Rs 113.9 crore. An industry executive said the losses of Oppo and Vivo had risen last fiscal as both had been spending a lot of money on marketing and retail expansion to gain market share. Both have changed their strategy of late besides cutting down on expenses, lowering the margins they used to offer and exiting several stores.Vivo India brand strategy director Nipun Marya said the brand is investing in India for the long haul. “While the full impact of these investments will take a few years to emerge, the fact is that our investment has already started showing results,” he said. Oppo India, which didn’t respond to queries, plans to borrow about $500 million in the form of external commercial borrowing to support business operations and expansion, according to its RoC filings.India is the largest market for Oppo and Vivo outside China, while it is the largest market for One-Plus accounting for about 30% of global revenue. OnePlus recently said global revenue in 2017 was $1.4 billion. IDC said Vivo is the thirdlargest smartphone maker in India with a 12.6% share followed by Oppo with a 7.6% share in the April-June quarter, the same as in the year earlier. Xiaomi and Samsung are fighting neck and neck as the top two brands."
"Largest telco Vodafone India Thursday said aggressive competition has made the domestic telecom market ""unsustainable"" and warned that if this continues it will make the country ""uncompetitive"".All three operators, including Bharti AirtelNSE -1.27 % and the deep-pocketed new entrant Reliance Jio whose aggressive pricing has impacted the sector, are ""burning cash"" at present, even though a 1.3-billion population presents enough opportunities for sustainable existence, the company said.There is a need for a ""rational"" play, Vodafone IdeaNSE -1.23 % chief executive Balesh Sharma said at his maiden media interaction after the mega merger--something that was forced on them by the aggressive pricing by Jio since its entry in September 2016.Pointing to the halving of the key profitability gague Arpu or the average revenue per user, even as their data and voice consumption has grown six times, Sharma said, ""the industry cannot invest in digital India, which will be the key to the success and competitiveness of the country in the coming years"".He compared the domestic telecom industry with that of China, saying the Arpus have come down to USD 1.3 per month here from USD 2.6 two years ago, while in China the same is above USD 8, making it possible for companies there to invest for growth and technology.In the September 2018 quarter, Jio led the Arpu chart with Rs 131.7 (still down from Rs 135 y-o-y), followed by Airtel at Rs 101, but massively down from Rs 142 y-o-y, and Vodafone Idea had the lowest at Rs 88.""Market repair has to happen, because, for one it is not sustainable and two, it makes India uncompetitive as even Jio is burning cash. There has to be a rational approach,"" Sharma said.It will be very difficult to predict the changes in the market for the better or the pace at which the changes happen, he said.Jio's entry two years ago has hurt each of the entrenched telcos, resulting in the merger of Vodafone and Idea, and exit by RCom and Tata Tele, apart from the financial and job losses and even bankruptcies.Also, barring Jio, none of the other two operators showed any growth in profit. While Jio reported a net income of Rs 681 crore, up from Rs 612 crore a year ago, Airtel reported a steep 65.7 percent fall in its net income at Rs 118.80 crore and Vodafone Idea a massive consolidated net loss of Rs 4,973 crore on a consolidated revenue of Rs 7,663 crore for the September quarter.Sharma also shared the way forward for the merged company, which is the largest with 422 million subscribers, irrespective of the pricing situation.He said work over the past 17 months since the announcement of the merger and completition on August 31 this year, has helped it advance its projected Rs 14,000-crore savings from the merger synergies by two years to FY21.Lots of benefits will come in by reducing towers where there is doubling, he said, stressing that this will be done without compromising on service quality as the better of the two towers will stay on.He said the merged entity, which covers less than 50 percent of the overall population with the high speed and high revenue 4G services, is targeting to increase the coverage to 70 percent by end of FY19 and 80 percent by the end of FY20.""This will be possible on the back of redeployment of the towers released in the doubling replacement,"" he said.When pointed out that rivals Jio and Airtel will cover over 90 percent of the population by the end of fiscal under such network, chief financial officer Akshaya Moondra said Vodafone Idea will chase only profitable opportunities and underlined that 80 percent coverage is sufficient.The company is also doing away with life-time free plans as a way to boost revenue by charging at least Rs 30 a month from such subscribers who are ""substantial"" in number, he said.The 1.2 billion SIM cards in use are largely because of double SIMs being used by a single user as over 40 percent of the rural population is still untapped, making it a handsome opportunity, Moondra said.Only half of the users are on 4G broadband and 48 percent of such ""2G customers"" are with Vodafone Idea, he said, pointing it as another opportunity and added that the company is also in talks to have affordable handsets and better tariff plans to ensure customer stickiness.Sharma said operating margins are on an upward trajectory now but declined to give a target.The company has drawn up plans to invest Rs 27,000 crore in FY19 through FY20, Moondra said, adding it has obligations of Rs 3,000 crore and Rs 12,000 crore, in remainder of FY19 and FY20, respectively, towards spectrum payments and interest cost.However, Moondra did not comment on the reports of the company starting roadshows for the planned Rs 25,000 crore capital raising exercise.when asked on 5G rollout, Sharma said at this juncture the country doesn't need 5G as there is no enabling ecosystem.Vodafone Idea shares tanked 7 percent at Rs 41.45 bringing down its market cap to a low Rs 19,732.4 crore on the BSE, while the benchmark Sensex shed 0.62 percent."
"MUMBAI: The Indian unit of Walmart, the world’s largest brickand-mortar retailer, posted a marginal increase in turnover during FY18, something the company attributed to changes in accounting norms after New Delhi implemented the biggest indirect tax reform since Independence.Walmart India’s turnover rose to Rs 3,654 crore during FY17-18. A year ago, it had expanded 13% to Rs 3,609 crore, according to the annual returns filed with the Registrar of Companies. The company hasn’t filed its profit numbers yet.“Due to GST, the numbers across the two years aren’t comparable,” a Walmart India spokesperson said. “Walmart India’s cash-and-carry business continues to show good growth year-on-year.”Net sales are not comparable as turnover in the last fiscal was calculated net of GST since May last year; earlier, it was gross of excise, which in turn was baked into the costs.In May, Walmart, which operates as a wholesaler in the country, acquired Flipkart for $16 billion to capitalise on India’s $670-billion retail market.Cash-and-carry operators sell merchandise to local kirana or neighbourhood stores, hotels, and catering firms. About 3% of the trade in all consumer product goods (CPG) moves through the organised wholesale segment and has been growing faster than the modern trade, albeit on a lower base.There are an estimated 10 million kirana stores in India and the majority of those are in the hinterland. While traditional wholesalers still have a big role to play in the distribution of FMCG products, organised ones expect to gain share due to the GST implementation.Most companies are reducing their dependence on unorganised wholesalers, especially after the new tax regime that made the distribution system more compliant. Even after demonetisation, the market saw a greater number of small grocers rush in to buy daily essentials from the big-box formats.“We have seen growth in our membership, particularly more and more kiranas becoming regular members, and more transactions,” added the spokesperson.The company’s expansion, which was put on hold between 2011and late 2017, was renewed this year after it opened three new stores to take its tally to 23 Best Price cash-and-carry outlets. Walmart generates about half its local sales from outside its big-box cash-and-carry stores, either through members directly ordering online or its sales force visiting B2B members for orders."
"MUMBAI: A high-level government committee that recently gave a clean chit to multinational professional services firms including the big four — Deloitte, PwC, EY and KPMG has, however, proposed some restrictions on these firms that may impact their revenues.The report of the ministry of corporate affairs committee has called for restricting the non-audit work these firms can accept from listed companies, and barring them from offering certain services to their audit clients. ET has reviewed a copy of the report. It seeks to impose two conditions on multinational professional service firms: that their revenues from non-audit work from a listed company should not exceed 50% of fees paid for audit work; and, they should not do taxation, valuation and restructuring work for companies they audit.The proposed norms are in line with global standards, industry trackers said. “The report seeks to restrict the auditors from carrying out certain services and it is adhering to the principle of independence of auditors,” said Dinesh Kanabar, CEO at Dhruva Advisors, one of the biggest Indian tax firms. “This will ensure that the auditors focus on what they need to do as auditors rather than look at opportunity to render other services to the clients.”ET spoke with India heads, audit practice leaders and several senior partners at the big four, and their next two big multinational service providers, BDO and Grant Thornton. They said such restrictions could cause a lot of disruption for companies they audit. “It would be impractical to actually implement these recommendations,” said the head of an audit practice. These firms are now conducting internal analysis as to how much impact these measures would have on them and what actions they could take in the coming year. Industry insiders said audit work may lose its charm among these firms.“If it comes to either or, then letting go of an audit client might be easier as we don’t get much revenue for auditing anyway,” said a senior partner with one of the firms. “We actually lose money on some of the biggest clients in auditing as we have to deploy hundreds of people but fees collected are paltry,” the person told ET.Audit accounts for about 15-20% of revenues of international professional service firms in the country with the rest 80-85% of their revenues coming from non-audit work such as taxation and consultancy. But some other services like taxation are sometimes packaged along with auditing. According to insiders, about 25% of the revenues of all the foreign firms come from non-audit work they offer to their audit clients. Most firms are seeing growth from their taxation and consulting verticals. Interestingly, it’s not just the international services providers that are upset with the expert panel report.Some Indian firms have come out against the report, alleging that it doesn’t represent the industry. “Some of the stakeholders like Sebi (Securities and Exchanges Board of India), Quality Review Board, Indian audit firms, and senior members of ICAI (Institute of Chartered Accounts of India) are not well represented in the report,” said Vinayak Padwal, partner at MSKA and Associates."
"NEW DELHI: Pune-based device vendor Swipe Technologies aims to reach $100 million in revenues over the next two years as it expands its product portfolio.  The Kalaari Capital-funded company, which today launched its new handset 'Elite Plus' priced at Rs 6,999, had clocked close to $45 million in revenues last fiscal.  ""We continuously seek feedback from the mobile phone users on their desired features and incorporate them in our new offerings. This has helped us become a popular brand among the youth... In the next two years, we are looking at revenues of $100 million,"" Swipe Technologies founder and CEO Shripal Gandhi told PTI.  He added that online sales account for over 50 per cent of its volumes. Swipe has previously launched three devices under 'Elite', its online-only brand.  Gandhi said the company expects to sell about 2 lakh units of 4G-enabled Elite Plus in the next four months.  Elite Plus features a 5-inch display, Qualcomm Snapdragon octacore processor, 2GB RAM, 16GB internal memory (expandable upto 64GB), 13 MP rear and 8MP front camera and 3,050 mAh battery."
"Fintech solutions player FIS India has recorded over $100 million in revenue and the firm is targeting to grow its topline faster than GDP growth of over 7 per cent in the coming years, a top official has said. A bulk 70 percent of the revenue accrue from the payments front, while the rest come from the legacy core banking systems for retail banks. ""We expect our growth in upper single digits over the next several years,"" FIS Global's chairman, president and chief executive Gary Norcross told here. He said the company has been present here for over two decades now and employs 14,000 across five cities at present they are engaged both in local sales and also creating solutions for the world. Its overall revenue stand at over USD 9 billion, while the worldwide employee base is 52,000, he said. At present, it is investing in both increasing its sales team and also on the delivery side, he said, adding the company had won a major chunk of domestic business from the newly formed payments banks and small financeNSE 1.68 % banks. It also serves entrenched lenders, helping them majorly on the payments side, Norcross said. At a time when a bulk of service providers in the automated teller machines (ATMs) segment are complaining and an industry body has also warned of shutting half of the overall 2 lakh machines, Norcross said his company is not unhappy about this vertical. ""We've been very pleased with our ATM business in the country over the last five plus years, and continue to see it as a nice business for us,"" he said, adding the company presently manages 14,000 ATMs for domestic lenders. As with all other markets, the company continues to be on the lookout for inorganic growth opportunities to grow in the country, but Norcross declined to specify any particular plans or discussions on this front with regard to India operations."
"MUMBAI | NEW DELHI: Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages (HCCB), the bottling partner of Coca-Cola India, has posted 4% decline in revenues at Rs 9,082 crore during year to March 2018, as per latest filings with the Registrar of Companies (RoC). The bottler had total sales of Rs 9,502 crore a year ago.Net sales are not comparable as turnover in the last fiscal was calculated net of the Goods & Services Tax (GST) since May last year.Earlier, it was gross of excise, which in turn was baked into the costs. HCCB, in its filing, said comparable operating revenue increased 7% and that it gained 2.3% share in sparkling beverages during the year.HCCB chief financial officer Harsh Bhutani said the company is making ‘steady progress’ towards its targets for 2020.“Our focus on product mix, plus the launch of several new products last year, helped us increase our net revenue by 7% versus 2016-17, on a comparable basis. The introduction of GST helped us in leveraging our national supply chain and drive productivity. We are continuing to invest in cold drink equipment, manufacturing capacity and towards horizontal expansion, which will catalyse strong, stable growth, going forward,” Bhutani said.HCCB, which makes Coca-Cola and Sprite soft drinks and Minute Maid juices, and accounts for two-thirds of Coca-Cola's revenue reported a net loss to Rs 118 crore during FY17-18, down from to Rs 233 crore a year ago.India is Coca-Cola’s sixth largest market. It has been broad-basing its portfolio to include low or zero-sugar drinks, dairy beverages and energy drinks to resonate with changing consumer preferences."
"Chipmaker Qualcomm India’s revenue jumped 23% in FY18 driven by a demand surge for phones in the world’s second-most-populous nation where the telecom industry is transiting rapidly to 4G data technology after the entry of RelianceNSE -0.27 % Jio. The San Diego-based company powered more than half the total smartphones sold in India and posted sales of Rs 5,426 crore locking in a net profit of Rs 518 crore in FY18, financials sourced from research platform Tofler showed.While the company’s growth slowed down from a year ago when it grew 39%, it has nearly doubled sales and profit over the past three years. “There are two aspects that have stood out for India; one, this is a growing market for smartphones and two, the telecom carriers have also rapidly adopted 4G, which has transitioned this market totally from 3G to 4G and now is moving the 2G to 4G,” said Rajen Vagadia, country manager of Qualcomm India. “This transition has been fuelled by solutions that Qualcomm provided, including the explosive growth of the Jio 4G feature phone at one end of the spectrum while our partners like Xiaomi have brought premium tier Snapdragon 845 at affordable prices,” Vagadia said.Reliance Jio, which started services in India in September 2016, helped spur data consumption in the country with its 4G-only network that forced rivals Airtel and Vodafone to slash tariffs. Overall, India mobile phone shipment crossed 300 million units for the first time ever with smartphones capturing almost 44% of the total volumes in CY 2017. Qualcomm said it has evolved over the last few years supporting end-to-end product engineering, contributing to technology innovation in areas such as 4G, IoT and now 5G. However, its Indian revenue doesn’t account sale of all its products in India since a bulk of its transactions are with global suppliers in the US and China, which in turn market them in the country. “Considering that most of the smartphones featuring Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chipset are in the mid and high tier segment, the sales value for the company easily runs in billions of dollars in India. Qualcomm India can further grow its revenues given the OEMs (original equipment manufacturer) and ODMs in India start sourcing products directly with the advancing manufacturing and designing ecosystem in India,” said Shobhit Srivastava, research analyst, Mobile Devices and Ecosystems, Counterpoint Research.Qualcomm has been working closely with the carriers in India helping bring features such as voice calls over a 4G LTE network and voice over wifi for Indian consumers. The chipmaker said most companies were looking to launch major global technologies concurrently in India, making the country the first or second market for such rollouts."
"Consumer durables maker Bajaj ElectricalsNSE 4.51 % is eyeing around 48 per cent growth in revenue to Rs 7,000 crore this fiscal, mainly driven by robust performance of its EPCNSE 0.59 % segment, said a top company official.The company's major growth is coming from its engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) segment, on the back of big orders of power distribution and transmission line projects in Uttar Pradesh.""We would end current fiscal with around Rs 6,800 crore to Rs 7,000 crore as per our estimates,"" Bajaj ElectricalsNSE 1.40 % Chairman and Managing Director Shekhar BajajNSE -1.28 % told PTI.Bajaj Electricals had posted a revenue of Rs 4,716.39 last fiscal, in which EPC had contributed around 2,500 crore.""We have done around Rs 2,900 crore in the last three quarters and do around Rs 1,100 crore in the fourth quarter and as per our projections, we would have around Rs 4,000 crore from EPC business,"" Bajaj said, adding that this would be over 60 per cent growth.He expects EPC segment to continue the growth momentum in the next fiscal also, although the pace may be slow.Besides, Bajaj also expects high double digit growth from its consumer product segment this fiscal.""The company would continue with 25 per cent growth projection from the Consumer Products segment and end around Rs 2,800 to Rs 2,900 crore,"" he noted.Moreover, Bajaj Electricals reported a Profit before exceptional items and tax (PBT) of Rs 100.02 crore in the October-December quarter this fiscal.""This is first time in the history of Bajaj Electricals, when we have crossed a PBT of Rs 1,00 crore. This is the highest ever for the company,"" he noted.Bajaj Electricals has two segments — Consumer Products and EPC."
"While Air India's passenger count rose by only 4 per cent in the December 2018 quarter, its revenue from passengers increased by 20 per cent on the back of better aircraft utilisation, said a senior official of the company.""Due to better and efficient utilisation of aircraft fleet, the passenger revenue increased from Rs 4,615 crore in third quarter of 2017-18 to Rs 5,538 crore in third quarter of 2018-19,"" the official said.The official added that the number of passengers has increased to 55.27 lakh during the quarter from 53.28 lakh in the year-ago period. ""This shows that passengers have increased by around 4 per cent but our ASKM (available seat kilometres) has increased at a much faster rate,"" the official said.ASKM indicates the passenger-carrying capacity of an aircraft. It is arrived at by multiplying the number of seats occupied by the distance travelled by the aircraft in kilometres during a particular period.The loss-making Air India is estimated to have a debt burden of over Rs 48,000 crore and the government's efforts for strategic disinvestment of the carrier failed in May last year.The official said passengers in December increased by 4 per cent but the revenue from them increased by 23 per cent during the month.""In the third quarter, total 15 new flights were started by the company,"" the official added.Speaking about the Air India's woes, Civil Aviation Minister Suresh Prabhu Friday said future revenues of the company cannot service its ""massive"" debt and this legacy issue has to be segregated from the current challenges of national carrier.""If you feel that future revenues can actually service the debt, it is not possible for the simple reason that the debt is so massive,"" Prabhu said Friday during a live stream held on 'Flying for All: Global Aviation Summit 2019'.Air India earns 65 per cent of its revenues from international routes, while the remaining comes from domestic network.""Also, the cost of interest on the debt, when you try to service it from your revenues, Air India can never be in profit. Therefore, we have to address the debt issue. We are proactively working with the Ministry of Finance to make it happen,"" Prabhu added.Air India has been making losses since the merger with Indian Airlines in 2007. The airline has a fleet size of around 122 aircraft currently.""We have prepared a plan, we are trying to professionalise the entire management of Air India, right from the CEO (chief executive officer) downwards so that there will be a proper management structure so that Air India can reach to newer heights,"" he said.""But anybody, who comes in, will ask this question 'how do I deal with the legacy'. The same question I had to address when I took over as a minister. The same question, Air India's new managing director or the new CEO or new board of directors would have to address - how do I deal with the past?"" he added."
"MUMBAI: Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corp (IRCTC) sold Rs 28,475 crore of train tickets online in the year ended March 2018, growing 14% on-year, but its overall income dipped due to withdrawal of service fee charges.The government-owned portal posted a 3.1% decline in revenue to Rs 1,544 crore while its net profit rose 3.4% to Rs 222 crore.Historically, revenue came from service charge on tickets, sales of Rail Neer packaged water, onboard catering services, and licence fees from outsourced catering vendors.But the service charge earlier levied by IRCTC at Rs 20 per eticket for non-AC classes and Rs 40 per e-ticket for AC classes were withdrawn by the ministry of railways after November 2016 to promote digital payment post demonetisation.“Withdrawal of service charge has resulted in a loss of Rs 693 crore in IRCTC’s 2017-18 turnover. Annual expenditure of Rs 80 crore incurred on website ticketing system, marketing, operation and after-sales service is being compensated by the ministry,” it said in a filing with the Registrar of Companies.An email sent to IRCTC for comments went unanswered till press time Friday.A year ago, it had lost revenues of Rs 575 crore due to the same reason, which means it had to forego nearly Rs 1,268 crore in ticketing revenue since November 2016, revealed data ."
"Bengaluru: E-commerce giant Amazon’s main India unit spent more than 20% of the revenues it earned on legal and professional expenses, underlining the regulatory complexity of the world’s most competitive online retail markets in the world.Amazon Seller Services spent Rs 1,145 crore on legal professional expenses for the year ended March 2018, 47% higher than the previous year, according to the firm’s filing with the Registrar of Companies (RoC), sourced from paper.vc.The company continued to spend big on areas such as faster deliveries and marketing to compete with bigger rival Flipkart, now owned by US retailer Walmart.The losses for Amazon Seller Services increased by 30% to Rs 6,287 crore during the financial year while operating revenues grew by 57% to Rs 4,928 crore, according to the RoC filing. Even with a continued increase in losses, Amazon saw faster growth in revenues at 54% to Rs 5,018 crore in FY18 against 43% growth in the previous year.The pace of increase in losses remained steady.Legal experts ET spoke with said the 20% share of legal fees of revenues was high for a company with large revenues. As per industry sources, Amazon also considers charges for services from its entity Amazon Development Centre India (ADCI), which offers technology support, as part of this segment, and part of the costs are likely to have gone up due to the scaling up of this group company.Flipkart’s legal expenses were much lesser than Amazon’s. The Indian e-commerce marketplace’s two main units — Flipkart Internet and Flipkart India — recorded combined legal bills to Rs 230 crore for FY18, 12.4% more than the previous year, according to RoC filings made earlier this week.Without commenting specifically on Amazon’s figures, Sanjay Khan Nagra, principal associate at Khaitan & Co, said legal charges have been generally increasing for companies. “The last year specifically saw several regulatory changes, and this may continue going forward. Increased M&A activity could also add to the legal charges,” he said.Amazon’s logistic costs, the biggest expense item, rose 20% to Rs 2,957.7 crore in FY18. Advertising expenses for the company picked up after a dip in FY17, going up by 16% to Rs 2,109 crore. Amount spent on salaries increased by 35% to Rs 748.5 crore. The company also saw royalty costs increase by nearly three times to Rs 270 crore from Rs 78 crore.Revenues from Amazon Prime memberships increased significantly, as the company reported ‘unearned revenues’ rising to ?75.8 crore from ?27 crore, which mostly entails payments in advance for Prime memberships and advertising.“The company continue to invest in establishing infrastructure, opening new fulfilment centres, and technology advancement due to which company loss increased to Rs 62,872 million,” Amazon said in its filings. “The company also continues to invest in launching new products and services for its customer and sellers. The company is confident on its future growth.”Amazon has so far infused Rs 25,090 crore in its marketplace business in the country, while it has also made steady infusions in its payments, logistics, cloud services, and food retail arm.While Amazon India and Flipkart together control 80-85% of the online retail market in India, the Seattle-based Jeff Bezos-controlled company continues to face an uphill battle to topple the local rival's leadership.This was evident during the recent sale event last month. Flipkart clocked $1-1.1 billion in GMV (gross merchandise value) in its five days of its Big Billion Days, up from $660 million last year, according to estimates of industry experts."
"Mumbai: A cricket-heavy calendar might bring big cheer to cricket crazy consumers but broadcasters are likely to find it increasingly difficult to expand the advertising moolah given the IPL in March and the cricket world cup later in June. Both these events are likely to draw maximum advertising revenue reducing the pie available for other events later in the year, broadcasters feel. Heavy spending is also likely during the general elections in April-May and is likely to draw a big chunk of advertising dollars.Cricket is already suffering a bit of a backlash if recent events are an indicator. Australia’s ongoing India tour, comprising two T20s and 5 ODIs, has not received a big response from advertisers, who may be saving for the IPL and the ICC World Cup. Industry experts say the T20s are selling for about Rs 7 lakh per 10 second slot, while the broadcaster is finding is difficult to sell the inventory of ODIs at Rs 5 lakh. The tour started on February 24 and will end on March 13, 10 days before the IPL opens.When the Indian team travelled to Australia late last year, the ad rates for a 10-second slot for the TV were in similar range of Rs 7-8 lakh for T20s, Rs 5-6 lakh for ODIs and Rs 1-2 lakh for Tests, despite matches not being in the primetime.“With almost 30-40% more cricket this year, it will be a good opportunity for advertisers to negotiate and get better price as we already see in the ongoing India-Australia series,” said Vineet Sodhani, CEO at media audit firm Spatial Access. “Cricket will sell, but broadcasters may not be able to get the best price.”The year 2019 is a cricket-heavy season much like the previous two years. IPL starts in March and the ICC Cricket World Cup at the end of May, literally monopolising consumer eyeballs and advertising money for the next three years.As per ESP Properties India, the specialist unit of media agency network GroupM, 2019 will break all records of cricket consumption on TV and digital.“2019 will be a year for sports and entertainment. With cricket on our minds for more than half the year, brands would want to revolve their game around the sport and the athletes,” said Vinit Karnik, business head of ESP Properties India.But the problem will lie after June when the world cup winds down. India will visit West Indies for two tests, three ODIs and three T20Is in July and August. In October-November 2019, India will play a three-match series against South Africa, followed by two test-match series against Bangladesh in India. In November, India will play two tests and two T20s against Bangladesh in India while in December, West Indies will come back to play three ODIs and three T20s.Sodhani added that with general elections, viewership till World Cup will also get fragmented."
"MUMBAI: Premium carrier Vistara’s annual net loss shrunk to Rs 431 crore in FY18 from Rs 518 crore a year ago on improved performance but the airline is some distance from profitability, and macroeconomic pressures building for India’s aviation industry do not sound promising.The airline, a joint venture between Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines, posted a 54% rise in revenues to Rs 2,137 crore during the year, according to numbers from Tata Sons’ annual accounts filed with the Registrar of Companies under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.The numbers show a marked improvement in performance. In FY17, Vistara’s net loss widened to Rs 518 crore from Rs 400 crore in FY16. Its revenue doubled to Rs 1,390 crore.During FY18, the airline added 6 planes to make it a fleet of 19 A320s. Currently, Vistara operates 22 aircraft. Its total number of flights grew to 104 from 76 as of March 2018. Now, it operates 112 flights. It flew 4.4 million passengers during the year. Vistara is procuring 56 more planes — Airbus A320neos, A321neos and Boeing 787 Dreamliners — in a combination of purchase and lease agreements.Both the Tata Sons’ airline ventures are lossmaking. According to the latest numbers filed with Bursa Malaysia, the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange, AirAsia India’s (the conglomerate’s joint venture with Malaysia’s AirAsia) net loss widened 2.6 times year-on-year to Rs 61.8 crore for the quarter ended June, while revenue jumped 86% to Rs 650 crore. The airline’s fleet size as of June-end was 18, a size similar to Vistara.Vistara has been trying hard to procure international flying rights to derive maximum synergies with its parent Singapore Airlines’ global operations. Current norms mandate a fleet size of 20 aircraft which Vistara fulfils. But ET on September 18 reported that its international operations may be delayed as the Central Bureau of Investigation is probing the change in rules that brought in relaxation in 2016. AirAsia executives have been indicted with irregular lobbying and transactions to have the rules changed.Vistara will also need to grapple with macro headwinds — fall of the rupee, rise in fuel prices and cut-throat price wars pressurising margins — that push the industry headlong into, or towards, losses.The rupee has fallen 14% against the greenback this year before recovering a bit in the last few weeks. Air fares have been falling 15-20% almost every season, perennially widening the gap between revenue and expenditure."
"MUMBAI: Cash-strapped Jet AirwaysNSE -0.11 %, which defaulted on loan repayments in December, has proposed to its banks that revenue from ticket sales be securitised against outstanding debt, said two people with knowledge of the matter. Jet chairman Naresh Goyal is also said to have approached the upper echelons of officialdom earlier this week in pursuit of a rescue by state-run banks, said one of the two people cited above.Goyal and the top management of India’s second-biggest airline by market share are to meet other creditors, including leasing companies facing delayed payments, early next week, he added. Jet is likely to propose a fresh repayment schedule that involves haircuts, said a person aware of the plan.Jet told ET it wouldn’t comment “on speculation.”The debt-laden and loss-making carrier said Tuesday it had delayed principal and interest payments to a consortium of lenders led by State Bank of IndiaNSE 0.11 %. People close to the development said the default is for less than a month, classifying the debt as stressed.Banks will likely be pressurising Jet to raise funds fast before this has to be categorised as a nonperforming asset (NPA) in 90 days, which means lenders will have to make provisions for bad debt.Jet has been unable to raise funds from 24% owner Etihad Airways and its lenders. Tata Sons explored a possible investment but nothing has come of this.“Securitisation of ticket sales would mean a chunk of the money from advance sales of tickets would go to an escrow account that can be accessed by banks against debt,” said one of the persons cited above. “The question is how much would Jet securitise as its own operations are running from the sales.”  One of the people cited above said lenders are unlikely to agree to Jet’s proposal as the money “would be too little” to cover repayments. Money from ticket sales, mostly via travel agents, reaches the airline in 10 days.Jet has a total debt of more than Rs 8,000 crore on its books. According to estimates by credit rating agency ICRA, which downgraded it after the default was made public, the airline has repayment obligations totalling close to Rs 6,500 crore by the end of FY21.Goyal had earlier proposed that the consortium of lenders convert a part of the debt into equity. The bankers have said they won’t help unless Jet’s own shareholders put equity into the airline.With the cash it had, Jet had a choice between making debt repayments and handing out salaries that had been pending for months. Jet chose the latter after pilots, in a November letter, threatened to stop flying planes if their salaries weren’t paid."
"Bengaluru: The Bengaluru International Airport (BIAL) posted a net profit of ?848 crore in the financial year 2017-18, a 33% jump from the previous year. The sharp increase comes on the back of ridership growth, a spike in rental income and higher revenue collections from user development fee (UDF).The 2017-18 annual report, uploaded on its website, shows the Fairfaxbacked Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) reported a total revenue of Rs 1,551.7 crore, an increase of 15% over the previous year.The spike in revenue from UDF, charged on passengers for the development of the airport, is one of the reasons for the increase in net profit. Total UDF collection went up from Rs 495.9 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 571.5 crore in 2017-18. Though the UDF tariff remained the same in both the financial years, the increase of Rs 75 crore in the fee collected has been attributed to the rise in ridership.Even the income from rentals shot up in 2017-18. BIAL earned Rs 74 crore more than it did in 2016-17 from retail spaces, building rentals, parking fees, etc. In total, the non-aeronautical revenue came up to Rs 578.9 crore, up from Rs 502.8 crore in 2016-17. There was, however, not much of a difference between 2016-17 and 2017-18 in revenue earned from other sources. This includes income earned from charging landing fees and aircraft parking fees. “The Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru, is a regulated entity and the aeronautical tariff is determined by the Airport Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA). Since the tariff is determined for a five-year control period, any higher/lower revenue earned in a particular year is trued-up during the remaining years in the period or the subsequent control period,” the BIAL spokesperson said.AIRPORT HANDLED 2.7 CRORE PASSENGERSThe Kempegowda International Airport handled 2.7 crore passengers between April 2017 and March 2018, a 17.6 % growth compared with the previous year. The daily ridership, on an average, comes to 73,000. So far, the airport has handled over 15 crore passengers, making it the third-busiest airport in India after New Delhi and Mumbai.Currently, the BIAL has undertaken large-scale infrastructure development, including construction of a second runway, a new terminal and underground tunnel. Once ready (early 2021), the airport will be able to handle about 65 million passengers. The total cost of the expansion work is estimated to be Rs 13,500 crore.The operators plan to use the profit towards these expansion plans.“The entire profit earned in the current year, along with accumulated earnings, is earmarked for use in the expansion,” an official statement, in response to a query, said. “The BIAL has not declared any dividend to shareholders from the profits earned for FY 2017-18. BIAL has declared dividend in only two years. And 92 per cent of the profits have been reinvested in the development of the BLR Airport.”"
"Bharti AirtelNSE -1.27 % expects its average revenue per user (ARPU) — a key performance metric — to improve from the January-March quarter, as the impact of its minimum recharge plans kick in and more 2G and 3G users upgrade to 4G.Gopal Vittal, CEO, said on Friday that the biggest ARPU growth drivers for Airtel would be higher contribution from the minimum recharge plans, benefits accruing from the recent price hike of the Rs 99 base bundled pack to Rs 119, rapid 2G customer upgrades to 4G and growing uptake of post-paid plans in the Rs 399 and Rs 499 range that come bundled with content from Amazon and Netflix.""We are seeing the first signs of ARPU climbing and as more 2G customers upgrade to 4G and get on to a bundle, there will be an immediate ARPU upside,"" Vittal said.He was speaking on an earnings call, a day after Bharti Airtel’s consolidated net profit slumped 72% on-year to Rs 86 crore in the October-December quarter, as a one-time gain helped the telco surprise the market which had expected a loss. Analysts said that the 4.1% sequential ARPU expansion to Rs 104 and largely flattish India revenue in Q3 is signal that the worst could be behind the telco.India’s second-largest telco’s shares closed 1.35% higher on BSE at Rs 311.30.The carrier isn’t ruling out more marginal customer losses in the coming quarters with the full impact of the minimum recharge plans and re-classification of Airtel customers as only those that transact and generate revenues for the company.The telco lost 58 million mobile phone customers in the December quarter after modification in its customer base measurement benchmarks.Sanjesh Jain, telecom research analyst at ICICI Securities, estimates that ""the clean-up of non-paying customers will trigger a jump in Airtel’s ARPU to Rs 118-120 in the fiscal fourth quarter, FY19.""Vittal said Airtel in its efforts to drive its core 2G user base to go 4G is rapidly refarming its 900 Mhz band spectrum for LTE services and will do the same with its arsenal of 2100 Mhz airwaves that are being currently used for 3G services.The company’s immediate target, he said, is maximising 4G customer acquisitions in the country’s top-1,000 cities, following which it will focus on expanding its 4G act to the next 5,000 cities.The Airtel CEO though said demand for smartphones and overall pace of feature phone users upgrading to smartphones would only rise if top device makers launch high quality smartphones in the Rs 4,000-5,000 price-range."
"KOLKATA: Bharti Airtel, India’s No. 2 telecom operator, and third-ranked Reliance Jio Infocomm may pull ahead of current market leader Vodafone Idea in terms of revenue market share (RMS) by the end of 2019 on the strength of their superior 4G networks, according to analysts and industry experts, especially with the newly created telco expected to focus mainly on integrating two vast companies and their networks. The coming year, they said, could also see the industry increasing average revenue per user (ARPU), helped by a chase for profitable customers and the prospect of higher data consumption in an election year.They said the year ahead is likely to see pricing stability for telcos as Jio, having cornered more than 275 million subscribers and nearly 27% RMS, is unlikely to lure customers in the way as it did over the past two years. The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), however, expects intense competition and ARPU pressure to continue in 2019 as well.“Airtel and Jio could end up holding roughly 33% RMS each by end-2019, while Vodafone Idea’s could drop below 30% by end-2019 from its near 33% level now, as the latter is likely to face network integration challenges and not be in a position to offer 4G services comparable with either Jio or Airtel,” said Nitin Soni, director (corporates) at Fitch Ratings.As per the regulator’s data at September end, Airtel’s RMS was 30.9% (343.5 million users), down 75 basis points or 0.75% points from the previous quarter, while Jio’s was up 375 bps to 26.1% (over 252 million users). Vodafone Idea or VIL’s was 32.8% (437.5 million subscribers. scribers), down a sharp 190 bps.This trend is expected to have continued in the October-December quarter as well, said analysts. “Next year will be tough for VIL as its cash flows may be insufficient to draw level with either Jio or Airtel on 4G capex spends,” said Soni.The market leader — formed in late August after the merger of then No. 2 Vodafone India and then third subranked Idea CellularNSE -1.23 % — plans to raise Rs 25,000 crore through equity and more by selling its fibre assets to take on competition. However, analysts said that may not be enough.ET’s queries to Vodafone Idea, Airtel and Jio did not elicit any response till late evening on Sunday.The Vodafone-Idea merger, as well as exits of several smaller players, was triggered by the relentless pricing aggression from Jio since its disruptive entry in September 2016, eroding revenue and profits. But experts said that with the late entrant having acquired scale and the telecom market having shrunk to three large players, the market is poised for a more stable pricing environment in 2019, signs of which had emerged in the second half of 2018 itself. Sanjiv Bhasin, executive vice president (markets & corporate affairs), IIFL, said he expects “pricing power to return in 2019” as he sees “Jio focusing more on revenue” and is unlikely to chase new customers with the same kind of intensity as seen in the past two years.The telecom expert at IIFL also said that the 2019 general election will also galvanise data consumption and induce many ordinary feature phone users to switch to 4G, which in turn will increase ARPUs, thus pushing up revenue year-on-year.Analysts expect overall industry data traffic to rise 20% year-on-year in 2019, helped in part by telcos expanding 4G coverage.Fitch Ratings’ Soni said he expects a 5-10% year-on-year industry ARPU growth in the next 12 months from the current Rs 100-105 level, driven by factors including a beneficial impact of minimum recharge plans rolled out by incumbents."
"MUMBAI: Walmart India, which runs 22 Best Price wholesale stores since its second entry into the country in 2019, is planning to increase the share of its private labels to topline to 10 per cent by next year as it plans to tap the Flipkart platform. The company opened its 22nd store in Ludhiana late last month, which is the sixth in the state, where it began with and the second in the Punjab city. The company will have 30 stores by the time it completes a decade of its second coming next year. Globally, the retail major which is bigger than Boeing, Coca-Cola, Facebook, and the Google parent Alphabet in total sales--nets around 20 per cent of its topline from private labels, which are low-priced but high margin items while from a volume perspective it is around 25 per cent, which it has already achieved in the country as well. Walmart India closed fiscal 2017 with a topline of Rs 3,609 crore, up around 14 per cent, according to government filing. The numbers for FY18 is not available for Walmart. ""Currently, our revenue from private labels is 6-7 per cent from our two brands--Right Buy and Member's Mark, wherein the first is the cheaper than the other. We hope to take this to 10 per cent by 2019, when we close our first decade,"" Walmart India chief executive Krish Iyer told . Internationally, its private labels are a USD 60 billion business for them under the name of Sams Club, while its total volume is over USD 500 billion. India is the only market where Walmart is only into wholesale. Iyer, also said he expects an uptick in private label sales going forward as the company is planning to cross-sell these brands on Flipkart, its online marketplace subsidiary here. In the biggest M&A deal, the world's largest retailed Walmart had bought 77 per cent of the homegrown online marketplace Flipkart for over USD 16 billion in August. It can be noted that FDI norms allow only 51 per cent in multi-brand retail, whereas in cash & carry 100 per cent is permitted. Flipkart also has developed private brands like Billion though not exactly in the grocery segment. ""What can be done is while we can't sell on Flipkart, our manufactures can do and vice versa, which can be beneficial for both,"" Iyer explained. But he was quick to add that both are independent companies with independent boards and the process can take time. ""Nothing will happen immediately at least over the next quarter or so. But we do see tremendous scope for synergies as Flipkart is very good at their logistics, deliveries, customer relationship management, artificial intelligence, machine learning and analytics, among others. We too have similar strengths, which can be combined,"" he said. The company made a reentry in 2009 after exiting its failed jv with Bharati Enterprises, on its own and opened the first wholesale store in Amritsar. The new 56,000-sqft store in Ludhiana is the sixth in the state and the first one since August 2015 in Agra. The company has announced plans to open 50 stores by 2025. When asked where it would be by the turn of the first decade (next year), Iyer said, adding they would have 30 stores by December 2019. We will also two fulfilment centres by then, and the next one is coming up in Vishakapattanam by December 2019. He said the company has created over 1 million customers since 2009, and each store typically generates around 2,000 jobs of which around 250 are direct jobs."
"KOLKATA: Reliance Jio has toppled Vodafone IdeaNSE -1.23 % and Bharti AirtelNSE -1.27 % in terms of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) from access services for the quarter ending September, making big revenue market share (RMS) gains on the back of strong performance in key states and rural mobile markets. In just over two years since starting 4G services, Mukesh Ambanicontrolled Jio’s AGR from access services (which excludes national long distance, or NLD, services revenue) stood at Rs 8,271.86 crore, compared with Vodafone Idea Ltd.’s (VIL) Rs 7,528.35 crore and Airtel’s Rs 6,720.91 crore in the September quarter, according to the financial data collated by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai). However, after including NLD revenue — which gets generated when a telecom operator carries a voice call from one circle to another — Jio’s overall AGR — or revenue derived from licensed services – stood at Rs 8,300 crore, below VIL’s Rs 10,500 crore and Bharti Airtel’s Rs 9,900 crore. Jio’s AGR was up 16% sequentially, while VIL’s and Bharti Airtel’s were down 6.2% and 3% quarter-on-quarter, respectively. Airtel’s overall AGR is inclusive of 45 days revenue of Telenor India, a company it had acquired in May. Therevenue growth has helped Jio expand its RMS by as much as 375 basis points (bps) quarter-on-quarter to 26.1% at the end of September. By contrast, Bharti Airtel’s RMS dipped 75 bps to 30.9% following losses in AGR in seven key markets, while VIL’s has plunged 190 bps sequentially to 32.8%, amid revenue declines almost across India. The combined pre-merger RMS of erstwhile standalone companies Vodafone India and Idea Cellular — which recently merged to form VIL —was at 34.7% in the June quarter. Bharti Airtel's RMS has virtually remained flat from 30.7% reported in the second quarter of FY18, while Jio's RMS during this period has more than doubled to over 26% from 11.6%, ICICI Securities said, analysing Trai data. “Jio is definitely on course to catch up with Airtel on RMS in the next quarter or two, and it’s amazing what took the incumbents some 20 years to accumulate on this metric, Jio has achieved in a little over two years,” Rohan Dhamija, partner Analysys Mason, told ET."
"NEW DELHI: Patanjali Ayurved's sprint to lead the FMCG race has witnessed a setback: sales fell for the first time in five years due to disruption by Goods and Services Tax and a weak distribution network. The company’s standalone consumer goods revenue declined more than 10 per cent to Rs 8,148 crore in the year ended March 2018—the first time since 2013, according to a report by Care Ratings, Bloomberg reported. “The decline was primarily because of its inability to adapt in time to the goods and services tax regime and develop infrastructure and supply chain,"" the report said. Now it seems the ambitious target set by yoga guru Ramdev, the founder and brand ambassador of Patanjali Ayurved, is nowhere in sight. Ramdev had wanted the company to reach Rs 20,000 crore turnover in three to five years. It had reached Rs 10,000 crore in revenues by FY16 from less than Rs 500 crore in FY12.ET Prime had revealed in May this year that Ramdev's Rs 20,000 crore dream was corroding the very soul of its business — its distribution network.A canny distribution strategy was a key factor behind Patanjali's meteoric rise. Patanjali's low-cost distribution system was remarkably efficient in getting its products acceptance against far heftier rivals. But that foundation is now under severe stress, ET Prime had learnt in a series of conversations with Patanjali associates. As the company doubled sales targets every year and set its sights on total domination over the Indian consumer, it developed an uncontrolled hunger for new distributors and new channels of trade, often at the expense of older allies.Initially, popularity of Patanjali products grew due to its own Chikitsalayas which later helped bring general trade on board at much lower margins than they would get from competing products of big FMCG companies.ET Prime reported that Patanjali's relationship with general trade strengthened at the cost of the once-formidable Chikitsalayas which the company ignored as it wooed general traders. Availability of Patanjali products at general stores hit the Chikitsalayas. “Initially, Patanjali had a policy to give products first to us only, but now the goods go first to general trade,” a Chikitsalaya owner in Navi Mumbai had told ET Prime. Till last year, Patanjali relied on exclusive partners to supply products. It’s now aggressively adding those who also manage supplies of large consumer goods makers like HUL and ITC, to Dhairyashil Patil, national president of All India Consumer Products Distributors’ Federation, told Bloomberg. Some items are in excess while there’s a shortage for others, and distributors were also sitting on damaged inventory, Patil said. “That’s deterred them from stocking Patanjali’s products.” Patil also said that nearly 90 per cent of the small outlets that exclusively sold its products faced supply crunch.The problems with the distribution network come as, according to Care Ratings, Patanjali is in the middle of a debt-fuelled expansion. Increased overhead costs because of the expansion, higher distribution and selling expenses, advertising and promotion expenses and higher dealer discounts and commissions will keep its performance subdued in the medium term, the rating agency said."
"Ford Motor’s revenue from selling vehicles in the Indian market rose 20% to ₹6,800 crore in FY18, a top executive said, attributing the success to increased local sourcing under an emerging market operating model.Including exports, the local unit of American automaker Ford Motor posted ₹23,120 crore revenue last fiscal year, 11% more than the year before when it was ₹21,000 crore. As much as ₹16,320 crore of its FY18 revenue came from exports. “Mature markets principle applied to the emerging markets does not necessarily work. You should have separate principles for the emerging market, defined by the emerging market,” said Ford Motor India MD Anurag Mehrotra.“Over the last 18 months, we have defined the principles based on an emerging market operating model. Every single function and strategy part is scrutinised with help of these principles, due to which we have been able to make the financial progress,” he said. “We are operating as an Indian company in the Indian market.”The company’s focus in the past year-and-half has largely been on improving the cost of ownership of its vehicles and dealership experience. It claims that the new Ford Figo Aspire, which was launched at a starting price of ₹5.55 lakh on Thursday, will have a bare minimum maintenance cost, thanks to increased local sourcing of material and parts. “Earlier we had 60% localisation of our products. Now it has increased to 80-85% which has resulted in low maintenance,” Mehrotra said."
"MUMBAI: Idea CellularNSE -1.23 % is plugging all possible revenue leakages and has most recently tied up with Route-Mobile to prevent messages on its network from landing for free. The move could save as much as Rs 8-10 crore that will accrue straight to its profit for the telecom operator that has slipped to fourth place from third since the launch of Reliance Jio.With the severe fall in profits it is time to crack down on any possible revenue leak, said a person in the know of the development. In the April-June quarter, Idea reported a 28% fall in revenue and more than trebled losses on services it offers. The company reported a net profit solely because of a gain from sale of its telecom towers.RouteMobile, primarily a messagebased services company, bought SMS firewall solution as part of its acquisition of 365squared, a Malta-based company. The solution helps prevent unidentified messages from terminating on the network. RouteMobile’s solution detects the origin of SMSes and allows operators to charge termination fees. Information messages, which include banking passcodes, updates, and sales messages are sometimes routed through unknown operators from Latin America or Africa. If the operator doesn’t have a tie-up with Idea, termination charges can’t be collected. The RouteMobile firewall will block such messages.“We are optimistic of our SMS Firewall, Analytics and Monetisation solution, which will offer a secure SMS channel to Idea Cellular and open-up a revenue channel,” said Rajdipkumar Gupta, MD, RouteMobile. Idea Cellular, which is also in the process of merging with Vodafone India, is increasing focus on intra-circle roaming between the two operators. Both operators have stalled capital expenditure to first maximise usage of the two combined networks. “The networks are working better together, we have improved the handoffs between the networks,” said a member on one of the technology teams. The networks are now switching between each other even if there is signal to improve the load sharing. This means that an Idea Cellular customer may get Vodafone network service if the Idea tower on the location is overloaded, and vice versa. Idea and Vodafone did not respond to ET’s query.The merger was announced last year in March but was held up for regulatory permission. Recently, Vodafone paid its disputed dues of nearly Rs 7,000 crore to the Department of Telecommunications to proceed with the merger. ET had earlier reported that even before the merger the two companies were working towards synchronising the networks by sharing networks and towers using roaming agreements to make the final merger quicker."
"Reliance Jio Infocomm has dislodged Vodafone Indian and closed to the gap with market leader Bharti AirtelNSE -1.27 % in revenue market share, helped by strong performance in the rural mobile markets and aggressive pricing that has left rivals struggling.Less than two years since starting 4G services, Mukesh Ambani-controlled Jio’s RMS widened 253 basis points (bps) on-quarter to 22.4% at the end of June, financial data put out by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) showed. Vodafone India’s RMS slumped 175 bps sequentially to 19.3%, while Kumar Mangalam Birla-led Idea Cellular’s share shrank 106 bps to 15.4%. Bharti Airtel’s RMS dipped 12 bps on-quarter to 31.7% as it staved off the impact of a cut in charges for receiving international calls in the first quarter, analysts said.Airtel’s RMS crept up from 30.7% in the second quarter of FY18, ICICI Securities said in an analysis of the Trai data. However, Jio’s RMS during this period almost doubled to 22.4% from 11.6%. “That Jio would surpass Vodafone India (independently) on RMS in the June quarter was expected, given its strong and sustained growth on this metric, but it now appears to be gradually getting within striking distance of Airtel,” Naveen Kulkarni, an analyst at PhillipCapital, told ET. Jio had overtaken Idea on RMS in the quarter ended March 2018. The company’s strong showing comes as Vodafone India and Idea prepare to close their merger, which will make the combined entity India’s largest phone company with an RMS of 35%, followed by Airtel and Jio.  Both Vodafone and Idea have been losing ground to Jio amid continuing price wars. The two companies need one final clearance from the company law tribunal for a formal completion of their merger, which has gone past their expected June-end closure. “Jio is enjoying a freeway in B&C (telecom) circles, and its strong performance in the June quarter can particularly be attributed to the C-circles where its adjusted gross revenue (AGR) rose 17.2% sequentially, contributing 17% to the company’s overall AGR,” ICICI Securities said in its note.A telco’s AGR is the revenue derived from licensed services. In terms of subscribers, Jio ranked fourth with over 215 million users at the end of June.Jio, which started in September 2016 with a nationwide 4G network, reported an over 14% sequential jump in overall AGR (including national long distance revenue) to Rs 7,200 crore in the quarter ended June, while Airtel’s rose 0.9% on-quarter to Rs 10,200 crore, inclusive of 45 days revenue of Telenor India, a company it acquired in May.Vodafone India and Idea suffered sequential falls of 7.1% and 5.2% on this score to Rs 6,200 crore and Rs 5,000 crore, respectively, said Sanjesh Jain, a research analyst at ICICI Securities. Overall telecom sector AGR climbed 1.3% on-quarter to Rs 32,200 crore in April-June, helped largely by Jio and Airtel’s growth.“Positive movement in industry AGR bodes well for the sector, which suggests the trend will continue, driven by a rise in mobile broadband penetration and reduced ARPU down-trading,” said an analyst at a global brokerage who did not wish to be identified. Jain of ICICI Securities added that it remains to be seen “if Jio is able to sustain its strong performance in the B and C circles where incumbent carriers are fast expanding their 4G networks.”"
"NEW DELHI: Reliance Jio Infocomm has surpassed Bharti Airtel to become the second largest telecom operator in terms of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) in the quarter ended June, latest data from the sector regulator show.Mukesh Ambani-owned Jio recorded an AGR from access services — or revenue derived from licensed services — of Rs 7,125 crore for the June quarter, up 14.6% from the previous quarter, while Airtel’s AGR fell 5.1% quarter-on-quarter to Rs 6,723 crore, according to the quarterly financial data released by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on Wednesday.The development underlines strong growth of the new entrant and declining strength of the erstwhile market leader. Jio had surpassed Vodafone and Idea CellularNSE -1.23 % individually in the January-March quarter, but would lag behind them now since the two merged to form Vodafone Idea at end of August.In the June quarter — before the merger had closed — Vodafone’s AGR fell 9.2% on quarter to Rs 4,483.68 crore and Idea’s dipped 7.2% to Rs 3,743.12 crore, to aggregate a combined Rs 8,226 crore. State-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd was the only telco other than Jio to show a growth in AGR in the June quarter, rising 6.8% on quarter to Rs 2,273 crore.Given the pace of Jio’s growth, analysts said it may not take long for the company to go past Vodafone Idea in AGR.Jio’s entry in September 2016 had unleashed a tariff war in the telecom industry, leading to erosion of the revenue of older operators, dragging industry AGR down, and triggering a consolidation by forcing a slew of exits and mergers.  However, helped by Jio and BSNL, industry AGR grew 2.40% in the April-June quarter at Rs 35,552 crore, after two successive quarters of sequential declines. Access services contributed over 70% of the industry AGR.Meanwhile, the telecom sector continued to see a slide in licence fee collection, which dropped 0.11% to .`2,929 crore for the June quarter. Spectrum usage charge fell 2.21% to .`1,023 crore in the quarter. License fee and SUC are paid by telcos to the government basis their AGR.The monthly average revenue per user (ARPU) for GSM service (in-cluding LTE) fell by 8.92%, from Rs 76 in the March quarter to Rs 69 in June quarter. As the industry players deal with low rates, customers are making the most of the free voice offers. Minutes of usage per subscriber have reached 608 minutes per month, up from 584 minutes a month in the March quarter.In terms of subscriber base at June end, Vodafone Idea with 443.5 million subscribers had 37.9% of the market share while Bharti Airtel (including Telenor and Tata) came in second with 32.26% market share and 377 million subscribers. Reliance Jio was third with 215 million subscribers and 18.42% market share."
"A shimmering white Jeep Compass car placed right next to the main entry of the Mall of India in Noida is attracting the eyeballs of visitors. Such displays not only catch consumers’ attention but are increasingly becoming an important source of revenue for malls operators.  Banking on events like these, prominent malls in India are trying to push their nonrental revenues from about 6-8% at present to 12% as malls with their high footfalls are seen by FMCG companies to carmakers as the perfect platforms to pitch their products to their target customer. For example, Fiat Chrysler Automobile is said to be shelling out Rs 1 crore for displaying the car in the Noida mall for six months, according to sources.  Similarly an advertising company has placed a huge digital screen near the atrium of Select Citywalk Mall in New Delhi that beams ads for products like smartphones to international holidays. The Delhi mall had earlier this year organized a mini “auto show” for half-a-dozen superbikes such as Ducati and Benelli aimed at attracting footfalls and to increase its revenues.  Suresh Kumar Kurapaty, founder of Umbrella Aegis, a Mumbai company that organizes marketing events in malls, said prominent malls in India charge Rs 5-10 lakh to display a car just for a weekend.  “Few years ago most mall owners did not plan and budget the non-rental revenue.  Now they do and it is a significant contributor to the revenue, especially large malls,” said Munish Baldev, chief executive of JS Martin & Co, a consultancy firm for commercial and luxury properties that works with malls owned by UnitechNSE 4.00 % and OmaxeNSE -0.07 %.  FESTIVITIES MARK THE START OF EVENTS The peak season for organising such events starts from mid-August which marks the end of summer and the onset of festivities. It continues through Onam, Dussehra, Diwali, Christmas, New Years’ Day and ends with the Valentine’s Day celebration in February.  The revenue from billboards, hoardings and other outdoor advertising vehicles also constitutes a large part of any mall’s nonrental income. “Almost half of the non-rental income for a mall comes from outdoor media vehicles, especially in smaller centres such as Amritsar where the number of billboards owned by malls is very high as compared to metros,” Baldev added.  Malls are currently taking digital advertising to a new level with tiny LED screens placed in front of urinals in bathrooms to installing giant screen in every nook and corner of the shopping centres. For example, Seawoods Grand Central Mall in Navi Mumbai has installed 55 digital screens in the mall, Kurapaty said. “That is massive and they are going to make big money out of it,” he said.  In April, High Street Phoenix created a fan park for Formula One fans by telecasting Bahrain Grand Prix on a giant screen even as they showcased various luxury cars from Jaguar, BMW and others. “While the nonrental revenue has been increasing by 10-15%, this is not a focus area for us. It can be a large contributor to the revenue of large malls,” said Rajendra Kalkar, president of West Retail Business at the Phoenix MillsNSE -3.42 % that owns High Street Phoenix.  Umbrella Aegis plans to bring 20 car, bike brands for an auto show in Select Citywalk mall in November. “In the central atrium we will bring luxury cars, superbikes outside the atrium and passenger cars and two wheelers outside the mall,” Kurapaty said."
"KOLKATA: Director General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) V P Joy said that the second round of bidding for Discovered Small Field (DSF) was expected to yield a revenue of USD 15.3 billion for companies for the next 20 years.Under the second round of bidding, 25 contract areas were offered for exploration covering an area of 3,000 square meters with a prospective reserve of 190 million metric tonne (mmt) of hydrocarbons, Joy told reporters here on Wednesday.Out of the 25 fields on offer, 15 were onshore and 10 offshore.Joy said that in the first round of bidding, under which 30 fields were offered for exploration in 2017, 24 petroleum mining licenses (PML) were signed, with the value of oil and gas production estimated at USD 6.5 billion for 20 years covering an area of 1,050 square meters.The bids were offered to new players to do exploration only where discovery of reserves had already been made, he said.Out of the 26 sedimentary basins across the country, seven had been already explored, he said, adding that the government had allotted Rs 3,000 crore to ONGCNSE -0.63 % and Oil India Ltd to carry out seismic survey for prospects of the remaining ones."
"KOLKATA: Bharti AirtelNSE -1.27 % could well regain its No. 1 ranking on revenue market share (RMS) in the next 2-3 quarters from Vodafone Idea (VIL) which is expected to lose ground during the integration process as it conforms to M&A rules while the Sunil Mittal-owned telco gains, mainly from its acquisition of Tata Teleservices’ consumer mobility business, analysts said.Rohan Dhamija, partner & head of India &Middle East, Analysys Mason, said there’s “empirical evidence” that when two telcos merge in a stable market, the “combined entity loses about 200 basis points of RMS” during post-closure, network integration.But in VIL’s case, he said, RMS loss “could be bigger” as India’s telecom market remains brutally competitive, with Airtel and Jio spending “much more on 4G capex and likely to focus on smartphone user additions over the next six months during which VIL will be busy with networks integration”. At press time, VIL did not reply to ET’s queries.Nitin Soni, director at global ratings agency Fitch, said, “Airtel could easily claw back RMS leadership from Vodafone Idea once it concludes the Tata Tele’s mobility business integration.”Airtel has lost its No. 1spot on RMS to VIL, but the latter, brokerage Credit Suisse said, only has a slim lead.Analysts said as per regulator’s data, Vodafone Idea’s RMS has fallen off from 40.7% in March 2017 (at the time of merger announcement) to nearly 33%, with Airtel (the closest rival) at nearly 31% with Reliance Jio catching up rapidly at third position with just over 22%.Airtel is awaiting National Company Law Tribunal’s (NCLT) nod for the Tata Tele deal, following which it will seek DoT clearance.Company CEO Gopal Vittal has already urged staff to leave no stone unturned in pushing for RMS gains.JM Financial said VIL faces a “tough situation” as it is losing revenue, whereas “Bharti is seeing stability while Jio continues to march ahead”.SBICap Securities said the newly created entity faces unrelenting pricing pressure from Jio, especially as the Mukesh Ambani-controlled telco “strives towards its stated 50% RMS goal by FY21”.Dhamija said VIL could see more RMS dips trying to conform to subscriber and revenue market cap rules under the merger process.Telecom M&A rules entail a merged entity’s combined RMS and customer market share (CMS) do not exceed 50% in any circle. VIL will have to comply with revenue share cap rules in a year, post-closure of its merger deal.At present, VIL breaches DoT’s prescribed 50% RMS cap in four circles—Gujarat, Haryana, Kerala and Maharashtra."

"NEW DELHI: Reliance Jio has overtaken Vodafone India to become the second largest carrier by revenue in the Indian telecom space, generating revenues of Rs 6,217 crore in the quarter ended March 2018, up 15% on-quarter.The new entrant has also quickly narrowed the gap with leader Bharti AirtelNSE -1.27 % whose revenue was Rs 7,087 crore, down about 10% on-quarter, as per data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).The Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio has been able to dislodge the No. 2 carrier by subscribers within 19 months of launching services where it offered free voice and low-cost data, triggering a price war that shows no signs of abating. The razor-edged competition has created more financial difficulties for the already stressed sector saddled with debt of more than Rs 7 lakh crore.The new carrier has, in fact, escalated the fight of low tariffs, expanding it from the dominant prepaid segment — it makes up 95% of the country’s subscriber base — to the post-paid segment, which makes up the remaining share but contributes around 20-25% of the industry’s revenue.As per the Trai data, the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of Reliance Jio — it has secured more than 200 million customers to date — was higher than Vodafone India’s Rs 4,937 crore for the quarter ended March, and also of Idea CellularNSE -1.23 % at Rs 4,033 crore.The details have come as Idea and Vodafone India prepare to merge to create a Rs 63,000-crore annual revenue entity with some 430 million subscribers.Together, the AGR of the combined entity would be higher than those of Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio.Overall, the industry AGR from access services fell by 12.6% on-year and 7.4% on-quarter for the March quarter to Rs 35,697 crore, with all private players but Jio showing a degrowth. For access services, the revenue decline was12.2% on-quarter to Rs 25,448 crore as of March 2018.Revenue of carriers such as Reliance CommunicationsNSE -3.57 %, Tata TeleservicesNSE 1.64 %, Quadrant and Telenor declined the sharpest in that order, since they’ve either closed operations or are in the process of doing so. Barring Jio, BSNL is the only carrier to have shown an increase in revenue collection, by a healthy 18% on-quarter to Rs 2,128 crore.  License fee and spectrum usage charges (SUC), which accrue to the government as a percentage share of AGR, have also reduced in quarter ended March 2018. Revenue from license fee fell by 12.8% on-year and 5.5% on-quarter to Rs 2,932 crore and that from SUC fell by 23.4% on-year and 8.8% on-quarter to Rs 1,051 crore as of March end. Goldman Sachs attributed the sequential fall in industry AGR during the March quarter to price cuts in January, reduction in international long distance termination rates and revenue consolidation among large players.The escalated competition among incumbents and the new operator has led to reduction in average revenue per user (ARPU), a key metric for determining profitability of a telco and of the industry. Trai data show that the blended ARPU per month declined 4.2% on-quarter from Rs 79.4 in the quarter ended December 2017 to Rs 76 in the quarter ended March 2018.Overall ARPU declined 8% on-year. ARPU of pre-paid segment declined from Rs 67 to Rs 62 in the same period, while ARPU for the post-paid segment increased from Rs 348 to Rs 360.As the industry players deal with low ARPU rates, customers are making the most of the free voice offers. Minutes of usage per subscriber have reached 584 minutes per month, up from 495 minutes a month in December 2017."

"The Indian Railways is expected to post total revenue of Rs 1.8 lakh crore in the current fiscal year, slightly short of initial target but 10% more than what it reported last year.A spike in coal loading and strong showing in the passenger category are driving the performance, Railway Board’s member-traffic Mohd Jamshed told ET. In the year ended March 31, 2017, the railways posted revenue of Rs 1.64 lakh crore.The target set in the government’s budget for this year was Rs 1.88 lakh crore, which has now been revised to Rs 1.8 lakh crore.Slower economic growth has not dented the railways’ business to the extent expected. The economy grew 6% in first half of fiscal 2018, down sharply from 7.7% in the same period last year.It expects Rs 1.12 lakh crore of the total revenue to come from freight loading and Rs 48,000 crore from passenger traffic. The remainingRs 20,000 crore would be from non-fare revenue cell, scrappage, monetising of railway land and compensation from the finance ministry for operating loss-making strategic rail lines in Kashmir and the north eastern states.In the last financial year, it made Rs 1.04 lakh crore by loading nearly 111 crore tonnes of freight and almostRs 46,000 crore from passenger traffic. The remainingRs 14,000 crore came from non-fare segments.In the current financial year, the railways is expecting to load 115.5 crore tonnes of cargo.Though this would be 1 crore tonnes short of its target of 116.5 crore tonnes, the railways is hopeful of an uptick in the last quarter as loading picks up generally in February and March.“Last year we saw unprecedented growth in March. We could expect the same this year. However, a lot depends on foggy months of December and January,” Jamshed said.In the non-fare segment, the railways is expecting to generateRs 2,000 crore as licencing fee from the Rail Land Development Authority, the organisation responsible for monetising railway land.Dynamic pricing in select trains and the launch of several new premium trains have helped boost revenue from the passenger segment, Jamshed said.The railways is losing Rs 800 crore a year after service charges were waived on digital ticket booking, he said."
"MUMBAI: For a newly minted partner in one of the Big Four professional services firms, becoming a stay-at-home dad had never crossed his mind. That, until last month.  He had joined the company as a partner in 2016, with a 30% pay hike, from a rival firm. With an eight-figure salary, a chauffeur-driven, high-end German car and a penthouse in a tony Bengaluru neighbourhood, it looked like a perfect job. He is now on gardening leave - a six-month cooling-off period that a partner must observe after leaving a job.  Another executive from a Big Four firm in Mumbai has found a liking for Marathi plays, as he is also on gardening leave and has lot of free time. ""I never knew plays could be so much fun,"" he said.  Suddenly several partners and senior directors at top consultancy firms, including at the Big Four of Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, EY and KPMG, are discovering different facets of life, and it's not the case of self-actualisation or even burnout.  With the dust around goods and services tax settling, and their clients getting the hang of the tax framework and handling the issues internally, these consultancy firms are witnessing slowing down or plateauing of revenue from a practice that has been a major driver of business and employment growth in recent years.  At least 20 partners and as many as 50 directors in top firms have either quit or will leave in the coming months, as they are unable to take the pressure on generating revenue, industry insiders said.  ET spoke to CEOs, tax heads and senior partners at several firms. While many of them avowed that there was pressure on revenue in the sector, most claimed that it was faced by their rivals and that they were unaffected.    A KPMG spokesperson said while the indirect tax revenue in the industry appeared to have plateaued, the practice for the firm was growing strongly. A PwC spokesperson said the company was building data analytics capability around GST to provide integrated solutions and that indirect-tax practice remained an important growth engine for it. EY and Deloitte did not respond to request for comment.  Insiders point out that between 2015 and 2018, revenue for large professional services firms from GST-related services grew at 50% annually. This has driven job opportunities, salaries and promotions for professionals in their indirect-tax verticals.  But now, the growth is estimated at about 10% on an average.  Many partners and senior directors who were lured from competitors, and in some cases other departments, with lucrative salaries and midterm raises are looking at potential job losses, as the GST framework becomes simpler, reducing the requirement of experts to handle it.  At multinationals, partners are given revenue targets and they get to take home around 30% of the revenue they generate. A large number of them have failed to achieve their targets this year, said people in the know. The total revenue from GST-related services is estimated at Rs 1,000 crore for the top 10 firms, including six multinationals - the Big Four, BDO and Grant Thornton. The top six had hired close to 3,500 people, including almost 100 partners, to handle GST services that bring them around Rs 850 crore a year.Utilisation, or the amount of time a professional spends doing billable work, has reduced to 60% or less now from as high as 95% around the time of GST rollout in July 2017, said insiders.""It's the case with every market in the world; there are mainly three stages of revenue growth after a new tax framework is introduced. First the phenomenal growth stage, then the plateau and then the gradual decline,"" said the tax head at one of the Big Four firms.""Now what we are left with is the compliance work in GST. The days of 40% and 50% jump in revenue are gone. We had increased the team size due to the sudden growth, now some of the partners will have to go,"" the India head at one of the multinational firms told ET.Senior people in the industry said they were also facing pressure due to the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence and automation.""Automation is also a big disruptor,"" a senior partner heading a GST team said. ""So, while earlier adding people meant adding revenue, now one doesn't need to add as many people to add revenue. So not only are we hiring less people, the revenue pressure is felt by those who are in the system,"" he said.""The upside lifted many boats during the GST launch euphoria, but the ones who stayed wise, not splurging on the short-term urge to increase headcount, aren't facing revenue pressure,"" said Suresh Nandlal Rohira, partner, Grant Thornton India, before adding that his firm was not facing any pressure. Many partners and directors who have seen a spurt in their salaries in last few years are exploring new things now.""I will just take it easy for now. I hope to plan a family,"" one of them told ET.""People who didn't have time to have kids are now thinking about that,"" said another. ""Those who have kids are looking to take them to Disneyland."""
"After the much anticipated public e auction of Taj Mansingh in September last year, a formal agreement was signed between between Indian Hotels CompanyNSE -0.43 % and the New Delhi Municipal Council under the revised terms and conditions on Thursday.NDMC officials said starting April 11, NDMC will get 32.5 % more revenue as against about 17.25 % under the previous terms and conditions for hotel Taj Mansingh. ""The revised agreement has been signed today. From this day onwards (April 11) NDMC will get 32.5 % more revenue as against about 17.25 %. This is the biggest achievement of the chairman of the New Delhi Municipal Council, who could plan the public auction , settle the legal litigation, auction the property and finally implement it on the ground. We may thank all specially ASG Sanjay Jain and our honorable council members for making it possible,"" said an NDMC official. After years of litigation and a bitter battle with the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) which reached the apex court, Indian Hotels Co (IHCL) retained the lease on the iconic property for another 33 years in a fiercely fought auction with rival ITC Hotels in September last year. The Tata Group company had submitted the winning bid at a licence fee of Rs 7.03 crore or 32.50% of the hotel’s gross turnover. IHCL was previously paying a monthly licence fee of Rs 3.94 crore or 17.25% of gross turnover to NDMC. NDMC put the property up for auction after IHCL’s 33-year lease ended in 2011. IHCL had been operating it since then through short-term extensions."
"NEW DELHI: Eros International expects about 75 per cent of its revenues from digital platform in the next three years -- up from 25 per cent now -- with increasing data affordability bringing more people online to content consumption, a top company official has said.Eros International MediaNSE 0.32 % is on the path of transforming itself from a ""full studio to a digital company"" as it is sensing a great opportunity in the OTT (Over-the-top) media services, the official added.""We think right now this year, out of USD 260-270 million revenue, digital would be USD 40 million. It's about 25 per cent of the total revenue. Fast forward after three years, digital would be three-quarters,"" Eros International Group CEO and MD Jyoti Deshpande told reporters here.She further said: ""For Eros it's about transforming, it's about completing the transformation from being a film studio to becoming a digital company. Film studio we would continue, we would continue to scale it but the goal is totally different.""Indians are now ready to pay for the movie contents, which are legitimately available for consumption within two to six weeks of their release, Deshpande added.""The product has to be good and we have 10,000 movies and music videos and more importantly, we are making originals. We are using our access to the film industry to make our own original shows,"" Deshpande said.The company is trying to make series on issues which include comedy and human trafficking.""Our goal is that we are going to launch one series a month,"" she added.The competition in the video-on-demand space has intensified specially after the launch of Reliance Jio's services that saw data tariffs in the country coming down drastically.While NetFlix plays in the premium segment, Hotstar and Amazon Prime are also competing aggressively for a share of the customer's viewership.New players like Yupp TV, Hungama and ALT Balaji are actively expanding their library with original programming to tap into the Indian market.Eros OTT platform has trebled its growth in the last one-and-a-half years.""In 2016, we had 400,000 paying subscribers and today we have 3.7 million paying subscribers...by March it will hit 6 to 8 million paying subscribers. For 2018-19, we would guide double of that,"" Deshpande said."
"NEW DELHI: The Indian telecom industry's revenue and operating income are expected to increase by 10% and 42%, respectively, in the fiscal year starting April 1, which would still be lower than FY2017 levels, ratings agency ICRANSE -0.42 % said.The industry revenue for FY2018 ending March 31 is estimated to decline by 13% on year and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation & amortization (EBITDA), or operating income, to decline by 34%, it said. It though expects the industry to recover from FY2019 onwards on the back of a consolidated structure, better pricing power and data usage with greater price inelasticity.ICRA said the industry debt levels, estimated at Rs 4.7 lakh crore as on March 2018, are expected to reduce to Rs 4.2 lakh crore by March 2019, with monetisation of tower assets and promoter support being main drivers. It, however, added that the debt protection metrics will continue to remain weak - estimated debt/EBITDA of 7.2 times as of March 31, 2019.“There has been a rush in the consolidation activity in the recent past-…these transactions, assuming they fructify, herald the emergence of an oligopolistic industry structure with larger and relatively stronger players. In addition, the industry has seen a consistently increasing data usage pattern which should give some price-inelasticity,"" Harsh Jagnani, Sector Head & Vice President – Corporate Ratings, ICRA, said.ICRA, however, added that there have been some silver lining for telecom operators such as expedited consolidation and increased data stickiness. These factors would lead to “gradual restoration in pricing power.”"
"Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) is revving up globalisation of its farm equipment sector, targeting 50 per cent of overall revenue of the vertical to come from international markets over the next three years, according to a senior company official.The company is focussing on three key markets --Americas, including the US, Canada, Mexico and Brazil; Japan and Turkey to be the primary growth drivers.It expects revenues from Americas to touch USD 1 billion in the next three years, up from USD 600 million at present, while it is also aspiring for business in Japan to touch USD 1 billion over a period of time as compared to USD 450 million currently.Besides, the homegrown farm equipment major is also charting out strategy to re-enter China in the implements segment after exiting from an earlier joint venture for tractors.The farm equipment sector (FES) of the company had clocked a revenue of USD 3.4 billion in 2017-18.""Currently, our global operations constitute 37 per cent of the revenues of FES. Over the next three years, we hope to see this go up to 50 per cent,"" M&M President - Farm Equipment Sector Rajesh Jejurikar told PTI in an interview.He said the company has drawn up a globalisation strategy with a differentiated strategy for each of the three key regions -- Americas, Japan and Turkey.In Americas, Jejurikar said the company has recently entered the above 80 hp (horse power) to 120 hp segment in US and Canada catering to the income producing segment such as commercial operators, landscapers and hay management.""Up until now in North America (US and Canada) we were only in the 80 hp and below segment catering to rural lifestylers, who are typically hobby farmers. We are number three in the segment,"" he said, adding still M&M was not present in hardcore agri segment in North America where there is requirement for very big machines.The other aspect of strategy in Americas is to expand further in markets like Mexico and Brazil, where the company is a relatively new entrant.""These are agricultural markets and we have been there only for last couple of years. We are competing in the agri space there,"" he said.Stating that there is a lot of similarity, specially with Mexico and India from agro-climatic point of view and the type of crops grown, Jejurikar said M&M's Indian products are suitable and accepted very well in these markets.""The challenge for us is to create brand awareness and build distribution network. We are doing that by creating our own subsidiary Mahindra Mexico and Mahindra Brazil,"" he said.Overall in Americas, Jejurikar said, ""We expect revenues to be USD 1 billion from USD 640 million over a period three years.""In Japan, he said, ""We are at USD 450 million at present. Our aspiration is to reach USD 1 billion but there is no timeline set for it.""The company is number four player in agri machinery segment and has a market share of around 6 per cent.""We have two areas of priority in Japan. One is to improve our market share in the local market and second is to enhance exports from there using some of the other markets which come in as a part of the Mahindra network,"" Jejurikar said.M&M is focusing on global centre of excellence (CoE) for rice value chain to create global access of harvesters and rice transplanters through Mitsubishi Mahindra Agricultural Machinery (MAM), he added.""The intent would be to take farm machinery to a global platform through the rice transplanters as well as rice harvesters thereby taking MAM beyond Japan,"" he added.Currently, Mitsubishi tractors are exported primarily to Mahindra USA, which get branded as Mahindra.""We are also looking at exporting transplanters from Japan to other markets, including to India. We already have a walk-behind rice transplanter in India and a ride-on should happen by the end of the calendar year and a harvester sometime next year,"" he added.In Turkey, M&M's three subsidiaries Erkunt Traktor, Hisarlar and foundry Erkunt Sanayii account for around USD 240 million of revenue.""While Erkunt Traktor has an aspiration to be the number two in its market, up from four at present, Hisarlar will look at proving mechanisation solutions for the complete agri value chain,"" he said.Being the fourth largest tractor market globally, Turkey presents a lot of opportunities, Jejurikar said, adding Hisarlar will be the CoE for farm implements.When asked about plans for China, he said, ""We are putting in place a strategy to return to the USD 25 billion farm equipment market in due course of time. We plan to venture on our own rather than look at a JV.""There is big potential for M&M to exploit farm machinery opportunity in China with rice transplanters and rice harvesters from Mitsubishi, he added."
"MUMBAI: Power transmission tower maker SkipperNSE 1.32 % targets revenue of Rs 3,000 crore by 2018-19 on the back of initiatives taken by the government to give a boost to the sector with schemes like UDAY.  The Kolkata-based firm, which is also engaged in manufacturing of PVC pipes and fittings, is betting big on the government's Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and smart cities programme and expects the contribution from this business to grow by up to 25 per cent from the current 8 per cent.  ""The government's initiatives on the power sector, urbanisation and sanitisation opens up new opportunities of growth for a company like us which is present in the business manufacturing transmission towers and PVC pipes and fittings. We expect to touch nearly Rs 3,000 crore revenue by FY19,"" company's Director Sharan Bansal told PTI.  He said with the implementation of the UDAY scheme, new orders are expected to come from the state power utilities which are currently reeling under financial crisis.  ""Besides, the private sector which had deferred the projects are now likely to bid in the next few years. We see this as a huge opportunity for growth in the transmission towers business,"" he said.  Bansal further said the smart cities and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has resulted in growth in demand for plastic pipes and fittings as well as water tanks.  ""We will continue to invest almost Rs 50 crore every year to enhance our manufacturing capacities both in the transmission and PVC business. Our aim is to achieve at least 20 per cent year on year growth in the bottom line and continue to be an asset light company,"" he added."
"KOLKATA: Reliance Jio Infocomm has become India’s third-largest telecom operator by revenue market share, dislodging Kumar Birla-led Idea CellularNSE -1.23 % and closing in on Vodafone India as its aggressive pricing strategy left rivals struggling.Just 19 months since starting services, Mukesh Ambani-controlled Jio’s revenue market share widened to almost 20% as of March end, according to financial data put out by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).Idea’s RMS slumped to 16.5%, while No. 2 Vodafone India’s share increased to 21%, just a shade above Jio. Sunil Mittal-led Bharti Airtel took its revenue market share to almost 32%, helped in part by its intra-circle roaming pact with Tata Teleservices, whose consumer mobility business the market leader is buying.Jio’s robust RMS numbers come as Idea and Vodafone India prepare to close their much-awaited merger this month, creating a Rs 63,000 crore revenue entity with some 430 million subscribers. Together, Vodafone and Idea will emerge as the market leader with a 37.5% RMS and the biggest user base, followed by Airtel and Jio. “Jio is already No. 1or No. 2 in 18 circles and has over 25% AGR market share in 15 circles,” ICICI Securities said.Jio, which started operations in September 2016 with a nationwide 4G network, reported an over 18% sequential jump in adjusted gross revenue (including national long distance revenue) to Rs 6,300 crore the quarter ended March, while Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea suffered sequential falls of 5.5%, 4.8% and 8.8% on this score to Rs 10,100 crore, Rs 6,700 crore and Rs 5,200 crore, respectively, ICICI Securities said in a note analysing the data collated by Trai, a copy of which was seen by ET.“Given Jio’s strong and sustained RMS growth, it could easily surpass No. 2 carrier Vodafone India (independently) on this metric in the first quarter of FY19,” said Naveen Kulkarni, a telecom analyst at Phillip Capital.Sanjesh Jain, a telecom research analyst at ICICI Securities, said Jio’s strong revenue share gains may have been triggered by “Bharti, Vodafone and Idea seeing sequential AGR growth in merely six, five and two circles, respectively, out of the 22 circles in the March quarter.” AGR refers to adjusted gross revenue, which is derived from licensed services.He added that Jio may have benefitted as Bharti, Vodafone India and Idea’s average revenue per user dipped by over 45% on-year in seven, two and eight circles, respectively, with customers likely switching to Jio to make outgoing calls, which are free, and using their older carrier connections to receive incoming calls.Goldman Sachs said the Trai data showed that “in 16 of the 22 telecom service areas, Jio is now a top 2 operator” in terms of AGR. Trai data, however, showed that the overall industry’s AGR shrank 8.2% on-quarter to Rs 31,800 crore.Goldman Sachs attributed the sequential fall in industry AGR during the March quarter to price cuts in January, reduction in international long distance termination rates and revenue consolidation among large players.Analysts expect the eroding revenue of Jio’s rivals to stabilise in the first quarter of FY19, with the tariff environment largely stable over the past few months and the rapid conversion of subscribers to data.Goldman Sachs said Airtel has the ability to defend its market share and boost profit when the tariff environment starts improving, given its strong network footprint and balance sheet. The recent acquisition of Telenor India, it said, “is likely to contribute an additional 1percentage point” to Bharti’s revenue market share in FY19.The US brokerage predicts “a 300-400 bps slower revenue growth for Idea vs Bharti over the next couple of years” owing to the former’s lower capital expenditure and investment in networks. Brokerage UBS said Bharti, Vodafone, Idea, Jio and the BSNL-MTNL combine collectively accounted for 98.2% of industry AGR and 91.1% of subscriber market share in the March quarter, implying that the remaining are fringe carriers."
"NEW DELHI: Railway minister Piyush Goyal has set a target of doubling the national transporter’s revenues to Rs 4 lakh crore by 2025 to make it profitable by then. Over this period, the total investment by the railways would be about Rs 9 lakh crore, he said.“Our target is to turn the railways profitable so that it doesn’t have to take any gross budgetary support from the government,” Goyal told ET in an interview. “We intend to double revenues by 2025.”The minister said his focus was to increase capacity by improving signalling, expanding the electrified network, adding more lines in congested stretches and enhancing utilisation of assets. “Reducing cost is the most important thing. If we were to electrify large parts of our network, we can easily save around Rs 15,000 crore in fuel bill itself,” the minister said.Indian Railways has prepared the plan to electrify a majority of its lines in another five years, which will help replace diesel engines with electric ones on major routes.“Also, just by introducing modern signalling on the golden quadrilateral route, we can increase the line capacity by 50%. These lines currently carry 58% of freight,” Goyal said. “Just imagine the kind of revenue we can get by just investing Rs 12,000 crore in signalling, which will allow us to run more trains in shorter blocks.” India’s first bullet train project that will connect Ahmedabad with Mumbai is on schedule. “We’re also looking at launching four-five more such projects between metro cities,” said Goyal. ET had reported that the project, which has a 2022 deadline, is facing land acquisition hurdles in Maharashtra. Goyal, also in charge of the finance ministry pending the return of Arun Jaitley from medical leave, said the NDA will get 350 seats in the 2019 general elections.He said the listing of Rites and Ircon would take place soon, while that of IRCTC and IRFC would be taken up later. He said the government was looking at non-fare revenues to increase investment in railways.STATION REDEVELOPMENTGoyal said 68 stations will be completed before March 2019. The rail ministry proposes to relax conditions to make it more lucrative for the private sector to invest in them. The railways has proposed that the private contractors investing in redevelopment of stations be given railway land for commercial exploitation for a fixed period. “We’ve prepared a cabinet note that proposes extending the lease period for concessionaires to 99 years. They will also be allowed to sublease the land,” the minister said. Goyal said he has asked the Indian Railways Station Development Corp. to lease out the stations and the adjoining land separately as the land parcels on its own would get better valuation.OPERATING RATIO AND REVENUESThe minister said the operating ratio of railways, which is more than 98%, has deteriorated because of the seventh pay commission payouts. Opera- ting ratio is the amount of money railways spends to earn every Rs 100. Goyal said he was planning to narrow the ratio to around 92% by curbing unnecessary expenditure.On his plans to increase revenue, the minister said that the 3,300 km of dedicated freight corridors being built at the cost of Rs 80,000 crore will give a big push to the goods-carrying capacity of the railways, which in turn will bring in revenue.The railways has a revenue target of Rs 2 lakh crore in the current financial year, which it wants to double in the next seven years, mostly by increasing its share of freight from 33% to 45%.“As we add more capacity, our freight rates will also come down, which will increase volumes,” Goyal said. “The speed of trains is also being increased, which will allow us to run more trains. All of it will help us earn more money. Average speed of passenger trains is also being increased by 25%.”He said various other measures were being considered to increase non-fare revenues. SAFETY AND PUNCTUALITYWhen asked about the patchy safety record of the railways, Goyal said train accidents were down 38% in the current financial year from the last one.He said that in the current fiscal, railways was planning an investment of Rs 70,000 crore on safety related work that included maintenance and renewal of track and eliminating unmanned level crossings besides improved signalling. He said he has asked officials to improve safety while maintaining punctuality, which has fallen to 65% in the past few months from 80%. The reason was more honest reporting, Goyal said."

"The gross revenue of telecom operators slipped 1.76 per cent year-on-year during the quarter ending March 2018, while licence fee and spectrum charges, that government collects from them, fell 12.7 per cent and 23.4 per cent respectively, according to a Trai report. The adjusted gross revenue or AGR earned by companies from sale of telecom services dropped over 12.5 per cent to Rs 35,697 crore during the January-March quarter 2018 from Rs 40,831 crore in the year-ago period. ""Gross Revenue (GR) and Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) of telecom service sector for the quarter ended March 18 has been Rs 62,198 crore and Rs 35,697 crore respectively... The year-on-year growth in GR and AGR over the same quarter in last year has been -1.76 per cent and -12.57 per cent, respectively,"" Trai said in the quarterly update it gives on the performance of Indian telecom services market. The gross revenue during January-March 2018 fared a tad better by 1.8 per cent compared to the previous quarter. However, revenue that operators derive purely from telecom services fell (7.37 per cent) even on quarter-on-quarter basis. The licence fee which is collected from telecom service providers on the basis of adjusted gross revenue fell 12.76 per cent year-on-year to Rs 2,932 crore in March quarter, while spectrum usage charges realisations fell more sharply by 23.4 per cent on yearly basis. The spectrum usage charges collected by the government stood at Rs 1,051 crore in March quarter, lower than Rs 1,152 crore derived in December 2017 and Rs 1,372 crore in the quarter ended March 2017. ""Monthly Average Revenue per User (ARPU) for Access Services based on AGR, declined from Rs 80.77 in quarter ended December 17 to Rs 71.62 in quarter ended Mar-18,"" the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) said in its report. The scorecard reflects financial difficulties that the sector is facing where a brutal tariff war has dented the profitability and operational metrics of most operators. According to Trai, the number of telephone subscribers in India rose to 120.6 crore at the end of March 18, from 119 crore in the December quarter, growing 1.31 per cent sequentially. The telecom sector in India - with second largest subscriber base globally - is undergoing financial stress, prompting a spate of consolidation that is expected to leave in its wake only 4-5 national level players.  The newest and the most aggressive entrant in the telecom sector, Reliance Jio, has sustained a bruising tariff war in the Indian telecom market, with its free voice and rock-bottom data offerings, challenging the established operators like Airtel, Vodafone and India Cellular whose revenue and profitability have come under tremendous pressure. Cellular Operators' Association of India (COAI), in its annual report for FY18, has noted that the telecom operators are in ""severe financial distress"" with a cumulative debt of Rs 7.7 lakh crore and revenue under Rs 2.5 lakh crore."

As the company grows, Seth said it would be a challenge to bring more variety to entertain the millions of customers on a daily basis.  ""How do we complement more entertainment for the customers and how do we offer more variety under food and beverages (F&B)? Can we bring more merchandising and add more ad revenue stream? That would be the two pillars of our strategy,"" he added."
"NEW DELHI: ZTE, the Chinese telecom equipment maker, has said profitability is still a challenge for the company in India, where telcos are reeling under revenue pressure and high debt. The company also called for lower 5G spectrum prices to enable telcos to invest in networks and subsequently, generate revenue for the government.“I don’t see a reasonable model of such a low ARPU-supporting operator business. It’s a very challenging situation for everyone in the industry,” Xiao Ming, ZTE’s president of global sales, told ET. “We are equally struggling in terms of profitability and we need to work hard together with telco partners.”India is already the top data-consuming country in the world, with very competitive prices that yield low average revenue per user (ARPU), a key performance parameter.“Almost everyone is suffering and that will require key vendorpartners to provide more competitive solutions to telcos,” Xiao said.ZTE follows its Chinese counterpart Huawei in expressing concerns over earnings.“Profitability issue is an open issue and is a general challenge in the Indian market. The industry is struggling and it is passing on the pressure,” Jay Chen, chief executive officer of Huawei India, had told ET previously.ZTE also backed cheaper prices for 5G spectrum, saying the technology would help attract new business models. However, monetisation of new use-cases will remain a common challenge for all.Indian telecom operators have asked the government to reject the regulator’s 5G pricing recommendations, which they said were too high and would leave them with little cash to invest in networks. Xiao backed their stance, calling for India to look at the pricing in other markets.“We have noticed that many partners in India are paying a lot of spectrum fees. I urge the Indian government to look at other countries to auction frequencies at cheaper rates so that telcos are capable of investing in next-gen technology, thereby helping citizens of the country, which will reward the Indian economy,” Xiao said.Verizon in the US and operators in South Korea are said to have started services on 5G networks earlier this month.The executive said the Indian telecom industry will evolve with the introduction of new digital services, which will benefit the sector.The Chinese telecom equipment maker works with Vodafone Idea, Bharti AirtelNSE -1.27 % and state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd in India. It recently bagged a 4G expansion contract from Vodafone Idea for five circles, which it shares with other vendors.The Chinese company will continue its focus on wireless mobile and fixed broadband to drive growth in India this year."

"NEW DELHI: The Delhi government has collected excise revenue of over Rs 3,150 crore from sale of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) in the year 2013-14, which is an increase of 10 per cent compared to the previous fiscal.  ""We have collected a total of Rs 3,151.63 crore in the year 2013-14 from sale of IMFL,"" Excise Commissioner J B Singh said.  This is an increase of 10 per cent compared to the previous fiscal year, according to a government official.  Singh said the Excise Policy for the current financial year has been approved by the government wherein revised duty structure has been proposed to be implemented so as to generate additional revenue of around Rs 300 crore.  The government had increased liquor prices by 8 to 12 per cent last month.  He said streamlining of tax collection has resulted in better revenue generation.  ""We are leaving no stone unturned in duty collection,"" he said.  The Excise Department had implemented Excise Supply Chain Information Mechanism System (ESCIMS) last year to check evasion of taxes on liquor sale.  Singh said under ESCIMS, scanning of bar code on liquor bottle is carried out from the point of manufacturing to the point of sale and there is very little scope of tax evasion.  He said vigorous enforcement drives have been undertaken by his department to check any malpractices by the licensees."
"BENGALURU: India’s highway liquor ban has forced some of the most prominent hotel chains in the country such as the Taj, Oberoi, Hyatt and Accor groups to stop serving alcohol to guests at key locations from April 1, threatening an estimated toll of Rs 65,000 crore in revenue foregone by state governments and the hospitality industry.  The move could lead to states losing overall tax revenue of Rs 50,000 crore, restaurants and pubs taking a hit of Rs 10,000-15,000 crore and 100,000 people going out of work, said Riyaaz Amlani, president of the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI).  Apart from the trade having to dispose of stocks, states will lose heavily. “State revenue losses are estimated at Rs 50,000 crore, besides job losses of over a lakh. We are in the process of putting together exact numbers but these are initial projections,” he said. NRAI is a lobby group that represents restaurants and pubs around the country.  Also Read-- Liquor ban: States want NHs converted to urban roads  Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant put the jobs at risk at 10 times that number. “Tourism creates jobs. Why kill it? Supreme Court’s highway liquor ban verdict may hit 1 million jobs,” he tweeted.  The Supreme Court has banned liquor vends within 500 metres of national and state highways including hotels and restaurants, from April 1.  The step has been taken as a safety measure to reduce accidents due to drunk driving in one of the most crash-prone countries in the world. Hotels affected by the ban included the JW Marriott, Taj Santacruz and Grand Hyatt in Mumbai; The Oberoi, The Trident and Leela Ambience in Gurgaon; and all the hotels in Aero City Delhi such as the JW Marriott, Hotel Pullman, Ibis and Holiday Inn.  Also Read: Hospitality industry to approach govt on liquor ban  “The obvious impact is that a number of outlets have to close,” said Shekhar Ramamurthy, managing director of United Breweries, the country’s largest beer maker. “When that happens, consumption comes down.”  The Beer Café promoter Rahul Singh said industry is working with various state legislations to create a prescribed buffer to minimise collateral damage. “Sale of liquor from a takeaway vend cannot be compared with on-premises consumption in a secure place such as a hotel or restaurant,” Singh said.  Liquor sales in India slowed to 0.4% in the first nine months of the financial year, the slowest growth in a market that’s been expanding rapidly since 2001, with a compounded annual growth rate of over 12% in the decade to 2011.  The top three -- United SpiritsNSE -1.30 %, Pernod Ricard and Allied Blenders, which account for 60% of overall sales -- had zero growth by volume in the April-December period.  The ban comes into effect as liquor makers stare at more sober days as increasing prices, prohibition in Bihar and an uncertain economy force consumers, particularly those at the lower end of the market, to check discretionary expenses.  A report by HDFC Securities values the Indian alcohol market at Rs 40,500 crore, of which the socalled Indian-made foreign liquor contributes 70% revenue.  “Rulings such as these negatively impact the alcohol as well as hospitality industry dramatically. (It) will do little to deter offenders. There is a need to educate and create awareness about aspects of road safety and dangers of drunk driving,” said Lisa Srao, managing director, Brands Beverages, which sells Three Royals and Granton whisky, Rum 99 and Granton XO brandy.  ‘MIGRATION TOUGH TASK’  With over a third of liquor outlets located around national and state highways, disruption will be significant, brokerage CLSA said in a recent report. “Given restrictions around educational and religious institutions, migration may be a tough task and could take a while,” it said.  For instance, restaurants in Gurgaon’s wildly popular Cyber Hub went dry on Saturday as it’s adjacent to National Highway 8, forcing habitues to hunt for other watering holes. Some asked whether it was an April Fools’ Day prank.  Some state administrations have reportedly re-designated state highways as district roads to avoid shutdowns. Specific to spirits giant United Spirits (USL), the CLSA report said: “We expect heightened volatility in USL volumes, margins and profitability as the company gears up for this ban, and a higher impact on lower-end brands.”  USL sells in close to 60,000 outlets across the country and the ban could affect about a third of those. “Our industry checks suggest that the ban has affected 30-40% of the outlets,” said a research report by broking firm IIFL Institutional Equities. “Given the confusion on how this ban would be implemented (whether shops would close/ relocate), retailers have undertaken channel de-stocking, which would weigh on fourth quarter (January-March FY17) sales.”"
"KOLKATA: ITC’s stated leadership ambition in India’s packaged foods business inched a step closer to reality last year, with a 13 per cent increase in sales closing the revenue gap between cookies giant Britannia and the century-old conglomerate that ranks third on the industry’s leader-board.  Four years after ITCNSE 3.15 % raced past Hindustan Unilever in the overall foods business, the cigarette company evidenced its makeover into a diversified group through double-digit growth in the consumer foods business, which crossed the Rs 8,000-crore revenue mark in the fiscal ending March 2017.  ITC’s foods revenue is now about Rs 600 crore less than that of Britannia: The gap was Rs 900 crore the year before. Swiss foods major Nestle is the country’s largest in this business segment.  In its latest annual report, ITC said its packaged food business revenue in 2016-17 increased to Rs 8,036.4 crore from Rs 7,097.5 crore the year before, compared with Britannia’s revenue of Rs 8,684.39 crore (Rs 7,947.9 crore the year before).  Nestle India had clocked sales of Rs 9,223.8 crore last fiscal (it follows Jan-Dec fiscal), while HUL’s revenue in packaged food and refreshment businesses together was Rs 5,972 crore. ITC, therefore, appears to be on course to realise its leadership goal by overtaking both Britannia and Nestle in the foods business over the next 2-3 years. The revenue growth would be brought about by the accelerated introduction of new products, and entry into 7-8 newer categories.  The company plans to introduce about 40 new food products in the next one year — a record for ITC — and has recently started selling premium chocolates and coffee. It is the market leader in packaged flour and premium cream biscuits, and the second-largest player in snacks and instant noodles.  The total revenue of the 25 FMCG brands of ITC spanning packaged food, personal care, education and stationary products, apparel, agarbatti and safety matches crossed Rs 14,000 crore during last fiscal, and increased by 16 per cent, the company disclosed in its annual report. Of this, Aashirvaad that operates in packaged atta, ghee, spices and instant meals is the largest brand at Rs 3,500 crore, and is growing by over 16 per cent. Sunfeast, which is into biscuits, sells in excess of Rs 3,000 crore.  Other brands such as Classmate stationary products, Yippee! instant noodles and pasta, Bingo! chips and Indian snacks are over Rs 1,000 crore each. Vivel soap, Mangaldeep agarbatti and Candyman confectionery are over Rs 500 crore each.  While ITC’s packaged food business is already profitable, the other FMCG businesses are yet to bring in the cash. The foods business is expected to be the majority contributor to its goal of achieving a turnover of Rs one lakh crore from its non-cigarette FMCG businesses by 2030. Of this, the foods business is expected to generate Rs 60,000 crore to Rs 65,000 crore.  ITC’s foods business chief executive Hemant Malik recently told ET the company can achieve the revenue goal, given the huge opportunities that lie in every segment, and the GDP growth rate that India will likely clock over the years"

The government's net indirect tax collections grew 16.9% year on year in January, with customs, central excise and service tax collections growing 10.1%, 26.3% and 9.4%, respectively, a finance ministry statement said on Friday.  “While the growth remains healthy, there has been a slowdown in the pace of expansion of excise duty and service tax collections in January 2017 compared to the nine months ending December 2016,"" said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ratings agency ICRANSE -0.42 % Ltd. “Nevertheless, the revised estimates for FY2017 for indirect tax collections of the GoI (Government of India) are likely to be achieved,” she said.

However, after adjusting for refunds, the net growth in corporate income tax collections in the first 10 months of the fiscal is 2.9% while net personal income tax collections have grown 23.1%.  Refunds amounting to Rs 1.41 lakh crore have been issued during April 2016-January 2017, which is 41% higher than the refunds issued during the corresponding period last year.  Indirect taxes growth is expected to slow down from February when the positive impact of the hikes in excise duty on fuels from November 2015 to January 2016 fades away. Nayar said this would result in further moderation in growth of excise collections."
"Footwear and apparel brand Woodland is eyeing a revenue growth of 15 per cent in the current financial year.  Aero Club, manufactures and retailers of the brand, is also trying to popularise the hi-fashion formal luxury brand 'Woods' in India.  ""Our revenue in the last financial year was Rs 1,200 crore from operations in India, Hong Kong, Middle East and CIS nations,"" MD of Aero Club, Harkirat Singh said.  He said the topline would grow by 15 per cent this fiscal, despite a slump in sales in July and August due to implementation of the GST.  Singh said the company currently has 600 stores, mostly owned, and its products are also available in 5,000 multi-brand outlets.  ""We plan to add 30 to 40 stores each year.""  Nearly 15 per cent of the company's business comes from e-commerce portals, he said.  On increasing the number of Woods stores in the country, Singh said, ""We opened two such stores in Delhi. Now, we are looking for space in Mumbai, Bangalore, Pune and Kolkata."" To a query, he added the company would expand its presence in tier-I and tier-II cities through the franchise route."
"NEW DELHI: Indian Railways has launched a non fare revenue policy to reduce its dependence on traditional revenue streams such as passenger and freight traffic.  The policy includes selling outdoor spaces at railway stations to media buying agencies for installing advertising hoardings and billboards, providing radio and video content through wifi on stations and on trains, leasing out spaces at platforms to ATMs and selling branding of rights of trains and stations to FMCG and other companies.  Railways expects that these initiatives have the potential to generate over Rs 18,000 crore of revenue.  The policy was launched by railway minister Suresh Prabhu on Tuesday. railways is already in talks with various brands for selling branding rights of its premium trains.  ET had earlier reported that railways was selling branding rights of seven premium trains including Rajdhani and Shatabdi on various routes for almost Rs 200 crore for a period of 10 years.  Railways in October had e-auctioned these trains to media buying agencies for vinyl wrapping and other branding activities."
"NEW DELHI: The Le Meridien hotel in Delhi is staring at an about 30% fall in F&B revenue this year. The hotel’s fine-dining restaurants which attracted a steady flow of patrons with their scrumptious dishes and specialty drinks, are up against a tough adversary -- the eateries nearby that are reeling out attractive promotions to woo customers who are now more open to ‘eating out’. And it does not help matters to have the critically-acclaimed Masala Library restaurant located right outside it.“Connaught Place is full of restaurants and people are more experimental now and are eating out. Footfalls have gone down,” said Tarun Thakral, chief operating officer at Meridien.The slip in food and beverages revenue is not just at Meridien—the downtrend is being seen in hotels across segments, as people eat out more and new fine-dining restaurants mushroom in the metros. A lesser number of guests are considering eating meals in hotels. Experts said the trend, already prevalent in markets like Europe and the US, is now gaining momentum in India. While Meridien is trying to get its skin back in the game by getting active on social media and tying up with food delivery firms likes Zomato for advertising and promotions for its restaurants, other large players are devising strategies to shore up F&B sales.Generally, revenue from F&B operations (including banqueting) goes up to as much as 50% for some luxury hotel chains. For upscale hotel brands, it could be about 25-30% of the business. “There is enough evidence that F&B revenues from restaurants in hotels are declining. Hotels are feeling the heat because of very stiff competition from standalone restaurants. Over the years, the quality of standalone restaurants has considerably improved,” said Mandeep Lamba, MD, India hotels and hospitality group at Jones Lang LaSalle Property Consultants. “Standalone restaurants tend to offer much more variety and are trendy. Under the new GST regime, standalone restaurants are able to charge 5%, whereas restaurants inside hotels still charge 18%. That is acting as another differentiator.”Competition from standalone places is leading hotel chains to refurbish existing concepts, revamp menus and tie up with online companies more aggressively.Gaurav Mudgal, director, revenue, at Fairmont Jaipur, said it is becoming increasingly important to “brickwall” guests to have meals in hotels.“Restaurants are opening up dramatically even in a city like Jaipur. We are on the outskirts and we have made changes like introducing kids’ menu, postponing some of our activities to late evening to incentivise guests to have dinner with us. We have done all this recently after studying the client behaviour. We need to improvise our strategies,” he said.At the Grand Hyatt in Mumbai, efforts are on to boost traffic on hyattrestaurants.com, Hyatt’s own F&B platform. “The focus will be to deploy all special offers and value adds to guests booking directly on the platform. Over the past year, we have forayed into bringing local experiences and chef-crafted menus through promotions at our venues, which has helped us understand the guests’ needs better,” said Puneet Singh, general manager at the hotel.An industry executive said when some global hotel brands in India launched years ago, their brand standard was to do two restaurants or more. “Today, they are more open. They have shut down the second restaurant in some hotels because they don’t get the footfalls,” he said.Hotel chains including Marriott and Leela did not respond to emails seeking comment.Dipak Haksar, chief executive at ITC Hotels and WelcomHotels, said chains like ITC have stood the test of time and have created well-researched dining concepts, which continue to drive brand loyalty. Vimal Singh, managing director, South Asia, for Louvre Hotels, said F&B needs to be reworked. ""We are facing huge competition. A la carte revenues are down. We will do banqueting and conferences, but we will reduce the number of restaurants in our hotels going forward,"" Singh said."
"PepsiCo India posted “solid mid-single-digit organic revenue growth” as strong marketplace execution and stable macro conditions spurred expansion across its key international markets.“We are pleased with the more than 6% organic revenue growth we saw in our developing and emerging market as a group,” chief executive officer Indra Nooyi said on an earnings call on Tuesday night. “The international results are in part a reflection of our efforts to increasingly lift and shift successful initiatives from one market to many and innovating on global brands in locally relevant ways.”PepsiCo did not specify the numbers of its India business. Analysts had expected the momentum of consumption demand and the receding impact of the goods and services tax in India to lead to improved earnings across consumer goods in the three months ended June.While the company’s soft drinks sales have stumbled in India and overseas, its earnings for the 12 weeks ended June 16, announced on Tuesday, exceeded analysts’ expectations, mainly riding on its salty snacks business.The maker of Pepsi and Mountain Dew, Tropicana juices, Lay’s chips and Kurkure snacks has been grappling with lower market share in its mainstay carbonated drinks business as consumers switch to healthier beverages.PepsiCo India president Ahmed El Sheikh told ET in an interview in May that the company would be selective in the categories it would focus on for profitable growth. “We need to be very sure where we will put our investments. To widen market share, we need to grow at a faster pace than the industry,” Sheikh, the first expat head of PepsiCo India, had said.“On a favourable base, we expect most FMCG companies to report double-digit sales growth… GST was implemented from July 1, 2017, onwards, and the preceding quarter was adversely impacted by the destocking ahead of GST implementation. EBITDA growth will be robust amid benign raw material prices,” India Infoline wrote in a report on Wednesday.Nooyi said that PepsiCo has committed to voluntarily remove trans-fats from snacks by reducing added sugars, sodium and saturated fats across all markets.“We are in millions of pantries and refrigerators worldwide. So we know we have a tremendous opportunity and responsibility to use our scale to make a positive impact,” she said."
"KOLKATA: Japanese consumer electronics maker Sony’s India revenue declined for the second consecutive year in fiscal 2017, which industry executives attributed to a slowdown in televisions due to intense price competition and a lag effect from the down-sizing of its smartphone business.  As per the company’s filings with the Registrar of Companies, Sony India’s revenue fell 11% to Rs 7,181.84 crore in 2016-17 from Rs 8,073.33 crore the year before. It had posted peak revenue of Rs 11,010.3 crore in 2014-15. When contacted, Sony India sales head Satish Padmanabhan said the drop in revenue was primarily due to restructuring in the mobile phone business. “All our other product categories have registered robust growth,” he said.  Incidentally, Sony India was expecting flat growth in 2016-17, managing director Kenichiro Hibi had told ET in May. He had then said revenue growth would be impacted due to the high base effect of laptop business, which it had exited as a global strategy in 2014, and exit from entry-to-mid level smartphones last year.  “However, if we consider just the television business, revenue grew by 20% last fiscal. This fiscal, we are targeting 20% revenue growth at a company level since the effect of laptop and mobile business has flattened out,” Hibi had then said.  Sony had last year lost the second spot in the overall LED television business to LG India. Several new brands have entered the television market, mostly through the online route, creating pricing pressure in the entry-level segment. The television business contributes around 60% to the company’s sales in India.  Sony this month re-entered mid-segment smartphones exclusively in India with two models, priced at Rs 12,990 and Rs 14,990, and started making them in the country. It also launched OLED televisions in the premium segment and is expanding local contract manufacturing to larger screens.  Sony has plans to launch a few more products in the lifestyle segment customised for the Indian market."
"Homegrown accessories brand Baggit is stepping up its volume and the product line to meet its target of clocking 25 per cent revenue growth in FY19.The privately held company had around Rs 160 crore revenue last fiscal year.""We are stepping up our production to play the volume game and are also launching new products to cater to various customer groups,"" Nina Lekhi, its managing director, told PTI.""We are looking a 25 per cent revenue growth in FY19, and a double-digit bottom line growth,"" she added without quantifying the numbers.It currently produces about 1.5 lakh pieces a month, which will be increased by about 50 per cent soon, she added.She said despite the note-ban and GST challenges, they grew in double-digits last financial year, when the revenue touched around Rs 160 crore.""Next year we are looking forward to further consolidate and grow faster,"" she said.While Baggit is present in Sri Lanka, she ruled out making further international forays as the focus will be domestic market.The brand is available in over 1,000 large format retail stores and receives 3-4 per cent sales through online. It also has nearly 50 exclusive outlets.The company also launched a private label collection recently, which will target premium clients.""As a brand, we are going premium but will remain affordable,"" Lekhi said."
"NEW DELHI: Hospitality chains are increasingly focusing on food and beverages operations to boost revenue and drive profits. Most hospitality chains say F&B operations now have a larger share in the overall revenue.  While F&B operations have always been a critical function at behemoths like ITCNSE 3.15 % and Taj, chains like Lemon Tree said F&B’s contribution to total revenue has increased by over 16% in the current financial year to about 23%.  ITC Hotels said its 7.3% increase in December-quarter revenues was in part due to growth in the food and beverages business. Last year, Leela became the only luxury hospitality group to expand F&B operations beyond its properties and outside India by launching its Indian restaurant Jamavar in Mayfair London.  “Overall, F&B continues to have growth potential. For example, at The Leela Palace, New Delhi, its two outstanding international dining brands, Megu and Le Cirque, along with an Indian restaurant, Jamavar, and an all-day dining restaurant, Qube, contribute exceptionally well to the revenue via F&B, especially since they attract high footfalls from local diners and gourmands,” said a company spokesperson.  Raj Rana, chief executive for South Asia at Carlson Rezidor said F&B operations contributed about 50% to the overall revenue of its 4 and 5-star brands last year, and sees its share growing this year. Carlson Rezidor has also made changes to its existing F&B formats. It is trimming down its F&B offerings to provide an all-day dining bar and one other specialty restaurant in its upscale properties from multiple outlets earlier. In the mid-scale segment, it is leaning toward room service and a loungecum-restaurant. For its under-construction hotels, the company is following a single-plate F&B offering.  “Instead of having a main kitchen and then multiple satellite kitchens, which mean higher costs and more workforce, the layout of the new hotels is such that we don’t need satellite kitchens, which creates more efficiency,” said Rana. Abhijit Umathe, associate director of hospitality and leisure for Knight Frank said growing F&B revenues could be attributed to market-driven room rates.  “Over the past five years, room supply has been getting added in major cities. Demand is growing, but not as much. Room revenues haven’t grown. So, the only room for expansion was in F&B,” said Umathe. “Room revenue is driven by corporate clients and the market. Discretion for the spender lies in F&B. So every year, in line with food inflation, hotels have been increasing F&B prices. To a certain extent, F&B is a recession proof business.”  For Marriott, while the outlook for F&B operations is pretty much the same as last year (F&B contributed 40-45% to overall revenue), the company is making some changes in its existing and upcoming properties. “Our new hotels in Aero City, New Delhi and Sahar, Mumbai have large coffee shops, all-day dining and a huge catering space. Coffee and catering spaces drive huge profits.  Going forward, we will rationalise the number of outlets. We will focus on one or two formats and get them right,” said Hemant Tenneti, senior area director of operations, South Asia."
"MUMBAI | BENGALURU: Amazon’s flagship unit in India Amazon Seller Services has more than doubled its revenues in the year ended March, leading rival Flipkart’s similar firm in terms of revenues.  Amazon Seller Services’ turnover for the last fiscal rose 116% to Rs 2,217 crore while Flipkart Internet’s sales increased 153% to Rs 1,952 crore during the same period.  Both units earn revenues through commissions, advertisements and shipping fees that they charge to sellers.  While the Amazon unit outpacing Flipkart Internet is a significant development, both companies operate through a complex structure which makes total revenues of their units hard to conclusively interpret.  Flipkart India, which runs the wholesale arm of the Singaporeregistered etailer, posted 34% increase in revenues for FY16 with sales of Rs 12,818 crore, compared with Rs 9,351.7 crore a year ago.  Amazon India’s wholesale unit has not filed its numbers for the financial year yet.  Experts feel Flipkart’s retail sales could be at least 15-20% higher than its wholesale revenues after including margins. Flipkart didn’t disclose profit or loss figures. It made a loss of Rs 837 crore in 2014-15.  Doubling of revenues of both the ecommerce giants indicates the rapid pace of growth in the ecommerce market aided by billions of dollars in overseas funding even as brick and mortar peers struggle.  Flipkart India’s turnover is now nearly double the country’s organised wholesale market that has players such as Wal-Mart and Metro Cash & Carry. Experts, though, feel the numbers are minuscule compared to other markets.  “Given the potential of the market, the numbers are still not huge and the pace of growth has come down. Even within the overall organised retail market, their contribution is just a fraction despite spending aggressively to gain market share,” said Harminder Sahni, founder of retail consultancy firm Wazir Advisors.  “Flipkart will have a tough time going forward in terms of funding as well as competing with Amazon,” he said.  The financial performance numbers are also reflective of the change of pace in investments by both the etailers. Amazon India has ramped up investment since 2015 as it looks to increase its market share, even as Flipkart has been focused on cutting its cash burn rate.  Flipkart Marketplace, a Singapore-based subsidiary and investment holding company which owns 99.74% stake in Flipkart Internet, received equity infusion of Rs 1,629 crore in fiscal 2016, significantly down from Rs 5,456 crore in the preceding year.  In comparison, Amazon Seller Services received capital infusion of Rs 7,463 crore in fiscal 2016, up from Rs 1,888 crore in the previous year.  The rivalry will only intensify — Amazon has committed $5 billion to the Indian market, and is outspending Flipkart by 3-4 times by investing aggressively in areas like video and grocery delivery. An Amazon India spokesperson said it is now the largest as well as fastest growing online marketplace."
"MUMBAI: Consumer electronics major PanasonicNSE 6.63 % India is eyeing a revenue of Rs 1,150 crore from the business- to-business (B2B) segment in the current fiscal at a growth of 35 per cent, a company official said.""For this year 2017-18, we are targeting around Rs 1,150 crore from the system sales division (the B2B business). Last year, we were around Rs 850 crore,"" Panasonic India Director B2B Vijay Wadhwan told PTI.Globally, majority of Panasonic's topline comes from B2B but it is only in India that the consumer division contributes more.In India, the B2B segment contributes close to 10 per cent of Panasonic's overall business.The Japanese firm has presence in India in 10 product lines, including projectors, panels, high-definition video conferencing, security systems, rugged laptops (under the 'Toughbook' brand), among others in the B2B segment.For the B2B division, almost 37-40 per cent of the business comes from imaging business. The solution network contributes around 30 per cent, signage business 20 per cent while the remaining comes from Toughbooks and Toughpads.""We are seeing growth in all the categories. Security in India has become very important not only in government and enterprises, but even for homes we are seeing a huge deployment. That is one segment which we see is going to be a huge growth driver. For Toughbooks and Toughpads we are seeing a lot of projects coming up,"" he said.The company is seeing demand from banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector and homeland security. It is also seeing traction from e-governance projects, retail and education sectors."
"HYDERABAD: The Indian hospitality industry is expected to witness decline in revenue growth in fiscal 2018 mainly due to regulatory hurdles leading to lower supply, said a senior executive of rating agency ICRANSE -0.42 %.  As against a growth of 8%-10% expected earlier, the industry’s revenue is expected to grow by 6%-7%. Also, the supply growth pipeline in the Indian premium hotel segment is likely to be muted at 5% incremental supply during fiscal 2017-20 as compared to the 17% growth during the supply peaks of fiscal 2010-13 and a softer 7% during FY13-16.  As against expectations of a 7% supply growth in FY2017, supply growth in the premium hotel segment was weaker at 5%-5.5%, on account of some delays/deferments in under-construction projects.  According to Subrata Ray, senior group vice-president and head, corporate ratings, ICRA, “The muted supply pipeline across several markets coupled with robust demand uptick will be the driver for the next up cycle in the industry over the next five years. However, near term prospects will be constrained by regulatory hurdles the industry is currently facing, namely liquor ban in hotels closer to the highways and temporary challenges associated with the impending GST roll-out.”  Meanwhile, the industry saw a mixed bag of performance in the fourth quarter. According to ICRA, revenue growth for the industry sample (of 12 large hotel companies) during Q4FY2017 remained subdued despite the pan India improvement in Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR).  In terms of pan-India average occupancy, the same grew by 2% to 64% during FY2017 compared to 62% during FY2016, while Average Room Rates (ARR) stood at approximately Rs 5,700 during FY2017.  Aided by upturn in occupancies and ARR traction in several markets, RevPAR for FY2017 increased by nearly 5-5.5%. RevPAR has been growing on a y-o-y basis for the past 11 quarters, indicating bottoming out of the industry."
"NEW DELHI: The revenue of the railways from both passenger traffic as well as freight movement has gone up by more than five and eight per cent respectively between April-December 2017 as compared to the same period previous year, a senior official of the railway board said today.The revenue from passenger fare rose to Rs 37,134 crore in 2017 as compared to the revenue of Rs 35,295 crore generated in the corresponding period in 2016. This shows a growth of 5.2 per cent, Mohd Jamshed, Member, Traffic, Railway Board, told reporters here.He also said that earning from freight went up by 8.39 per cent during the same period. While in 2017 (April- December), it generated Rs 80,691 crore, in the same period in 2016, it earned the railways Rs 76,288 crore.Railway Minister Piyush Goyal recently said that the railways had set a target to triple its freight traffic to three billion tonnes by 2030 from the existing 1.1 billion tonnes."
"MUMBAI: Starbucks, the world’s largest coffee retailer, posted per-store sales that were more than two-and-a-half times higher than its largest rival during its second full year of operations in India, thanks to its premium pricing and locations that attract more customers. While losses have narrowed, profitability remains a challenge, with each store still losing about Rs 60 lakh annually on average.  Tata Starbucks, a joint venture between Starbucks and Tata Global Beverages, generated total revenue of Rs 171.2 crore in the year ended March 2015, according to its annual report filed with the Registrar of Companies on Monday. That’s an 80% jump from the previous year, when it posted sales of Rs 95 crore through 43 outlets.  With 72 stores until March, a back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that each Starbucks shop sold coffee, snacks and merchandise worth Rs 2.38 crore in 2014-15, higher than most other cafes and quick-service restaurant chains. Starbucks didn’t comment on the figures.  Coffee Day Enterprises, which runs the country’s top coffeehouse chain, Cafe Coffee Day, had retail revenue of Rs 1,326 crore from 1,538 cafes, or about Rs 86 lakh annual sales per store.    Starbucks also overtook Jubilant Foodworks, which had over 930 Domino’s Pizza and Dunkin’ Donuts outlets and clocked sales of Rs 2,074 crore last year, equivalent to Rs 2.23 crore per store on average. A year ago, Jubilant’s Rs 2.3 crore per-store sales was a tad higher than Starbucks’ Rs 2.2 crore.  Experts said while revenue at Starbucks is substantially high by industry standards, sales and profitability will be a challenge. “CCD pricing is much lower than Starbucks, which reflects in the difference in per-store sales. However, pricing of Starbucks needs to improve once they gain coverage and expand in Tier II and III cities,” said Ruchi Sally, director at retail consultancy Elargir Solutions.  “High sales so far is due to global brand value attached, pricing and increasing economies of scale.”  In FY15, Tata Starbucks’ loss narrowed to Rs 47 crore from Rs 51.8 crore a year ago. Over the past year, the coffee chain invested Rs 120 crore to expand India operations.  Starbucks, which opened its first India store in October 2012, now has 78 outlets and its pace of expansion has been a record in Starbucks’ 43-year history. The Indian unit of the Seattle-based company added 29 stores in 2014-15 in a market that’s been subdued over the past two years with consumers not eager to spend amid economic uncertainty. Chains such as Yum! Brands – the operator of KFC and Pizza Hut – and McDonald’s and Jubilant FoodWorks have reported negative or single-digit growth in the past two financial years.  For global coffee chains, including Starbucks, consumers are attuned to a takeaway culture, which helps them add margins at very little cost. In India, however, many officegoers and students go to cafes to relax and spend hours over coffee and snacks. Also, real estate costs in India are high, making it important for retailers that average price realisation per square foot of space."
"NEW DELHI: The Indian Railways is estimated to have posted an all-time high revenue of Rs 1.68 lakh crore in the just-ended fiscal year, powered by its focus on boosting freight traffic and innovative steps on passenger fares.  The national transporter hauled 1.107 billion tonnes of cargo in the year ended March 31, surpassing its most recent target of 1.094 billion tonnes for fiscal 2017.  Railways minister Suresh Prabhu said his aim for this fiscal year is to do 1.2 billion tonnes. The performance was remarkable for an organisation that in the early months of fiscal 2017 was witnessing a major slump in freight and passenger traffic. Key interventions by the ministry since helped it get on to the growth track.  The passenger segment is estimated to have posted revenue of almost Rs 48,000 crore last fiscal year, up Rs 2,000 crore from the year before, while freight revenue is estimated at Rs 1.09 lakh crore as against Rs 1.04 lakh crore in fiscal 2016. Non-core revenue, such as from scrap sales and advertising rights, and other income totalled Rs 11,000 crore. ""Despite the most challenging environment, we have done very well. Various policy interventions at times when we could foresee slump in demand were taken, which were pivotal in bringing back the traffic,"" Prabhu said.    The steps the ministry took in the past year included additional discounts on loading of some commodities, doing away with various usage charges on freight, as well as innovative pricing of premium passenger trains, such as dynamic pricing on Rajdhani and Shatabdi.  In fiscal 2016, Indian Railways posted a total revenue of Rs 1.62 lakh crore. After setting a record in fiscal 2017, the financially stressed national transporter is now expecting to improve on that in the new financial year.  ""We have put in place the necessary infrastructure. There's availability of rakes and demand from various commodities is already seeing an uptick,"" the minister said. ""The various freight reforms we introduced in last fiscal will show a major impact now.""  The Railway Board's member-traffic, Mohd Jamshed, said the railways lost business to carry almost 20 million tonnes (MT) of coal last fiscal year due to weak demand for the dry fuel, but made up for that by transporting more iron ore. It hauled 137 MT of the steelmaking raw material, compared with 117 MT the year before.  ""Last time we loaded so much iron ore was during the time of Beijing Olympics [2008] when there was huge demand from China. This time, without any such factor, we have made record loading,"" Jamshed told ET.  He said loading from the expanded freight basket, which also includes automobile transportation, has also seen an uptick.  However, despite the signs of recovery in financial health of the national transporter, its operating ratio – the amount it spends to earn each Rs 100 – continues to remain high at around 95 per cent, leaving it with little funds for safety and maintenance projects.  In fiscal 2016, the ratio was around 94 per cent. ""The operating ratio will be high because our salary bill has gone up significantly in the wake of the Seventh Pay Commission. We spend more than Rs 40,000 crore only towards pensions,"" a senior Railway Board official said.  The railway ministry has been working on an agenda, set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to transform the organisation. Under it, the ministry has prepared a five-year development plan, which includes a capex of Rs 8.5 lakh crore."
"MUMBAI: Google India’s annual revenues jumped 44% with business doubling in the past two years. Google India Pvt Ltd posted a turnover of Rs 5,904 crore during the year to March 2016, outstripping its last year’s growth of 35% to Rs 4,108 crore.  The company did not disclose its profit numbers. The US technology giant has several Internet-related services and products such as cloud computing and other software, but bulk of the revenue is driven by the advertising service that displays ads next to search results.  While Google didn't respond on its financial performance, the company said it is at a very interesting point in India’s internet journey.  ""Digital advertising has now reached scale in India, with over 350 million users on the internet already, and over 200 million smartphone users.  This has opened the opportunity to reach all SEC A and B audiences and an increasing number of SEC C and D consumers,"" said Rajan Anandan, vice president, India and South East Asia, Google. ""We have introduced several new product innovations targeted at performance and branding that is helping advertisers achieve unprecedented scale at unparalleled levels of efficiency.""  Google enjoys a certain monopoly with most marketers spending more than two-thirds of their digital spends on it, experts said. ""Google is virtually most of the digital in the country.  As popularity of digital grows by every quarter, the importance of Google cannot be undermined or underestimated,"" Sam Balsara, chairman, Madison World, said.  ""Google helps you search, it is the first port of call when you want to look for something and therefore enables discovery and is critical when it comes to generating leads and ultimately sales.”  The New York-based market research company eMarketer estimates that digital media accounted for 12.6% of total ad spends in India in 2015 but it is expected to cross $1 billion or 14.3% by 2017.  ""Digital has not really taken off and whatever little we have done, the only recourse seems to be Google, since it has many options, primarily You-Tube and ad words search,"" said BK Rao, Deputy Marketing Manager at Parle Products. ""People are not as hooked on to Facebook as they were a few years ago and its subscribers, or users, have also slowed down.""  No wonder, Google’s formidable social network rival Facebook India posted Rs 177 crore in revenues during the year, a measly 3% of Google's annual turnover in the country.      The company said it is seeing explosive growth on mobile search and advertisers are leveraging new products such as PWA (Progressive Web Apps), AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) and Universal App Campaigns (UAC) to significantly improve the number of conversions at very lower costs. Innovations like TrueView enable advertisers to only pay when their ads are seen, while new formats like bumper ads provide massive reach.  ""As a result, we have seen that many advertisers have been able to influence their brand metrics and directly drive offline sales driven by YouTubeled branding,"" said Anandan.

"MUMBAI: Essar Shipping aims to increase third-party cargo handling to 50% of its total revenue by 2020 from 30% at present, as the company engages with companies in India and the Gulf, trying to make up for loss of captive business after the parent group’s oil refining company was sold and the steel business got stuck in bankruptcy proceedings.“We are working with steel companies, not just in India but also Qatar and Bahrain among other Middle Eastern markets. We are focusing a lot on the Gulf areas which are in close proximity to us,” CEO Ranjit Singh told ET in a recent interview.The company needs to look for new clients with a chunk of its captive business gone. Essar Oil was sold to Russian oil giant Rosneft, fund UCP and Swiss commodities trader Trafigura for $12.9 billion last year. Essar Steel is under insolvency proceedings before the National Company Law Tribunal. Essar ShippingNSE 1.97 % has also bid for the tender floated by staterun oil marketing companies Bharat Petroleum Corp and Indian Oil Corp for carrying crude oil. Some clarity on the bids will emerge by end of April, said Singh, adding the company is looking to acquire a very large crude carrier (VLCC) and a Suezmax if it wins the deal.Essar Shipping handled 13.06 million tonnes of cargo in FY17 and registered a 28% growth in total cargo tonnage in the third quarter of FY18. The company is set to increase capacity from 15-16 million tonnes to 20-21million tonnes by FY19 with increase in tonnage and higher operational efficiency.The company operates a fleet of 14 ships that include two VLCCs, one capesize ship, six mini-capesize ships, one panamax bulk carrier, two supramax bulk carriers and two 13,000 dead weight tonnage (DWT) general cargo ships. Analysts said getting fresh third party business wouldn’t be so easy in these times of still weak economic activity and oversupply in shipping capacity.“Charter rates are still on a downward spiral and there are numerous players in the market. The problem of overcapacity persists and it would be difficult to get new business for a player,” said a senior analyst who didn’t want to be named. Singh said that while the dry bulk has improved since its downward spiral starting 2008 — the benchmark Baltic Dry Index has increased four times from its February 2016 low — the crude segment has hit “rock-bottom”."
"BENGALURU: India has become online education company Coursera's second biggest revenue earner, Nikhil Sinha, chief business officer of Coursera, told TOI. The India revenue crossed revenue from the UK earlier this year.  Soon after Coursera was launched in 2012, India became its second biggest market in terms of the number of registered users. Currently , it accounts for 1.5 million of the 21 million registered users.But paying users grew dramatically in the past year.  Paying users who complete their courses receive certifications and degrees that are now highly recognized by industry . Sinha said the most popular courses in India are those related to technology , data science and business management. A high proportion of non-paying users tend to drop off from courses midway , but among paying users, about 65% complete the courses. Coursera offers courses from top global universities including Stanford, Princeton, Yale, Johns Hopkins, Duke and Caltech.From India, it offers courses from the Indian School of Business (ISB), Hyderabad.Sinha said 75% of those who opt for ISB courses are from outside India.  That's the core proposition of Coursera. It allows some of the best educational institutions in the world to reach out to a far bigger audience than they can through their campuses. And it allows students who cannot afford to go to these institutions to receive a high quality of education at a fraction of the price of a campus education. Coursera has raised abo ut $146 million in venture funding till date. The US, where it was founded, is its biggest market. In India, it recently launched an enterprise platform through which it will provide courses for employees of companies. Axis Bank is the first customer. Companies can curate specific programmes based on their needs and track the employees' performance in each course. On Tuesday , it partnered with Manipal Global Education Services to offer curated educational content to Manipal Global's more than 1.5 million learners and alumni community. The learners will receive certifications from Coursera and Manipal Education Group."
"The long-term outlook for the hospital sector is stable with annual revenues likely to grow at 12-14 per cent over the next five years on rising demand and medical tourism, rating agency IcraNSE -0.42 % said today.The agency expects the growth momentum to improve the credit metrics of the companies operating in the sector.""The long-term outlook remains stable notwithstanding the current headwinds and regulatory challenges in the sector,"" it said.Icra expects demand to continue rising at a steady pace owing to the underlying fundamentals, including growing population, increasing life expectancy, rising incidence of non-communicable diseases related to lifestyle, and increasing health insurance coverage.Medical tourism is also expected to boost revenues, according to the agency, given the affordability and quality of care in the country.""We expect an annual revenue growth of 12-14 per cent over the next five years, which is also likely to result in the improvement in credit metrics of the companies operating in the sector,"" it said.Over the last few quarters, the performance of the hospital sector has been affected due to multiple regulatory interventions in the form of demonetisation, price caps on medical devices and the goods and services tax (GST).The performance of five listed hospital chains in the country, which together operate more than 20,000 beds suffered as a result of regulatory interventions, according to Icra.""In nine months of FY18, the growth in aggregate revenues of the sample set slowed down to around 9 per cent against growth of around 15 per cent in the first nine months of FY17,"" said Shubham Jain, vice-president, Icra.The operating profits before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation (OPBIDTA) growth was around 15 per cent in first nine months FY17, which fell sharply to minus-3 per cent in first nine months FY18.The aggregate operating profit margins also declined from 15.1 per cent in the first nine months FY17 to 13.7 per cent in the first nine months of FY18, resulting in decline in absolute OPBIDTA from Rs 15.02 billion to Rs 14.90 billion during the same period.Jain noted that additionally, on a year on year basis, all quarters of the first nine months FY18 saw weaker revenue growth and decline of over 100 bps in operating margin.According to Icra, a major development for the industry has been the announcement of the National Health Protection Scheme (NHPS) in the 2018-19 budget that envisages health insurance cover for 100 million families (around 500 million beneficiaries) for a sum of up to Rs 0.5 million per family per year.""Launch of a government-funded healthcare plan of this scale has the potential to significantly increase the healthcare spend in the country,"" it said.The agency expects the introduction of NHPS to likely improve the occupancies at implementing hospitals albeit with lower profit margins.Jain said regulatory intervention in terms of pricing caps are expected to continue to exert pressure on the margins in the near term.""However, the hospitals may gradually offset these costs over the medium term by general hike in tariffs and by re-looking at the pricing of various procedures, products and services,"" he added."
"MUMBAI: As the Indian Premier League is coming to its season finale, advertisers will have another big sporting property to put their ad dollars on in the form of the FIFA World Cup, the biggest and most followed sports tournament in the world.And with just 30 days to go, official broadcaster Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN) has set itself a target of at least Rs 250 crore in ad revenue from the tourney.“We are looking at a reach of over 100 million viewers and advertising revenues of Rs 250-270 crore in advertising,” Rajesh Kaul, president-sports & distribution at SPN, told ET. “This year, with the World Cup being held in Russia, there is a lot more excitement as the live matches will be aired during the prime time for Indian viewers.”SPN will air the matches on six channels across four languages: Hindi, English, Bengali and Malayalam. The matches will also be aired on SPN’s over-the-top platform Sony Liv as a free service with a 5-minute delay and live be- hind a paywall for paying subscribers.On advertising front, Rohit Gupta, presidentnetwork sales & international business at SPN, said: “We had 38 brands on board during the Rio World Cup (2014). This time, we are targeting many more advertisers as the timing is good and youth audiences’ engagement level is huge when it comes to football.”With a 30-day countdown, SPN on Tuesday kicked off its marketing campaign to build more excitement about the tournament and has planned a 360-degree marketing campaign and multiple activities across TV, radio, print, digital and offline.While football viewership is already high in India, highprofile FIFA-led events tend to enjoy an increased following. The FIFA World Cup is one of the few sporting events that draw in both fans and fringe-viewers to root for their favourite countries."
"NEW DELHI: The global e-commerce industry generates over USD 1.2 million every 30 seconds, with a major chunk of the sector's revenue being cornered through social media, says a joint study by Assocham-Deloitte.  Facebook, Pinterest and Twitter contribute USD 5,483, USD 4,504 and USD 4,308 respectively every half-a-minute to the figure.  The study report added that the maturity of social media and its reach across masses and classes makes it a suitable platform for online sales.  Social media pages provide information regarding new products in the market, user reviews and ratings of the product, recommendations and IT products, it said.  ""Social media helps e-tailers to build brand awareness by responding to customer queries. Seasonal sales and offers are displayed in social networks to reach maximum number of people.  ""E-tailers have even started to motivate customers with reward points to provide feedback on the product on social networks,"" Assocham Secretary General D S Rawat said.  According to analysts, product reviews and ratings, as well as product recommendations, were the most popular social commerce features integrated into leading e-commerce sites.  ""Social networks have direct links to e-commerce sites, which provide complete product description, availability status, pricing and delivery information, and access to product reviews and ratings, all of which help prospective buyers to make a purchase,"" the study pointed out.  Besides, payment gateways help the e-tailers receive money instantly rather than waiting for the Cash on Delivery payments, thus reducing chances of theft and fraud, it said.  The retailers are slowly moving towards payment gateways for improving security and dealing with other complexities which arise with financial transactions. Banks as well as the e-tailers are offering different offers like cashback and Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) to encourage customers for card-based payments.  The availability of e-commerce applications on various mobility devices is helping to drive sales and revenue. E-tailers like Flipkart, Amazon and Jabong now get 50 per cent of their revenues from consumers shopping on their mobile phones, the study added."
"Yoga guru Baba Ramdev, who calls himself a brand ambassador of Patanjali Ayurved, has set for the company an ambitious target—Rs 20,000 crore in annual revenues. The company that started out as a small pharmacy quickly grew to challenge multinational FMCG giants as it expanded into diverse products. It's revenue for 2016-17 crossed Rs 10,000 crore from nearly Rs 500 crore just six years ago.Ramdev said last in April that Patanjali was working on a single-point agenda of capturing 25-50% market-share in the Indian consumer market from multinational firms. “In the next 3-5 years, I have set a target of Rs 20,000 crore to Rs 25,000 crore turnover for my company. We will leave the multinational companies in our dust, that is our open agenda,” he said. But it seems the company is already huffing and puffing on its way to the Rs 20,000 crore finish line. “We have closed the year around the same level as the previous fiscal year’s revenue,” Acharya Balkrishna, managing director of Patanjali, said in an interview to Mint.Patanjali had reported revenue of Rs 10,561 crore for the year ended 31 March 2017, more than double the Rs 5,000 crore in the previous year. The growth slide from more than 100% to nearly zero can mean the slowing down of Patanjali. But Acharya Balkrishna attributed it to lingering effects of the demonetisation and the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). He said the company invested its energy in developing infrastructure and supply chain during the year. It focused on system development, and not just revenue growth. Or Patnajali could be burning out from the scorching growth it has registered over the past few years. From a small pharmacy just a decade ago, Patanjali has now become an FMCG giant on the back of several products such as cow’s ghee, Dant Kanti toothpaste, Ayurvedic medicines, Keshkanti shampoo and several kinds of soaps. Patanjali began challenging the dominance of multinationals after its partnership with the Pittie Group about four years after the company decided to sell beyond its exclusive network of Arogya Kendras and Chikitsalayas. In 2012, the Pittie Group began distributing Patanjali products in general trade. Two years later, it took the products to modern trade too. Patanjali really arrived when Aditya Pittie also began supplying products to a big retail chains like Reliance Retail, Spencer’s and DMart. When they started out, Ramdev and his aide Acharya Balkrishan were written off as swadeshi evangelists operating mostly in pockets of hinterland for a select consumer segment. But with their canny business sense, they beat many FMCG giants to emerge as challengers to the leader, Hindustan Unilever."
"CHENNAI: Air-conditioner manufacturer Blue StarNSE -0.32 % Ltd is eyeing Rs 3,000 crore revenue during the current financial year from its product business, a top company official said here today.  The company currently retails commercial refrigerator, water purifier apart from air-conditioners and had registered Rs 2,500 crore revenue from this vertical in last financial year.  ""Currently, our product portfolio is air-conditioners, commercial refrigerator, and water purifier.

"MUMBAI: Hotel chains may soon start earning more from food and beverage (F&B) than room revenues as F&B revenue has been growing constantly over the past five years while room revenue has been dipping.	According to a recent HVS-FHRAI report on the Indian hotel industry, revenue from F&B segment - which includes banquets and restaurants - rose to 42.6 per cent in 2014-15 against 36.6 per cent in 2010-11, while room revenues declined to 50.9 per cent in 2014-15 from 57.2 per cent in 2010-11.	""There has been a marked, double digit growth in food and beverage revenues over the past couple of years. Within the F&B segment, banqueting is showing great potential, which is powered mainly by MICE and this has positively impacted our F&B revenues, boosting overall revenues at ITC Hotels,"" said Dipak Haksar, chief executive, ITC Hotels and WelcomHotels.	With F&B in hotels across India becoming a key revenue driver and contributing anywhere between 35 and 50 per cent to overall revenues, hoteliers say the success of food and beverage can make or break a hotel.	For the Oberoi Group, close to 40 per cent of its revenues come from food and beverage. ""For us, the ratio has moved from 35 per cent to 40 per cent on an overall basis. As more and more Indians start dining out, we believe that food and beverage will play a very important role going ahead. To give you an example, Indians only dine out twice a month while the Chinese are dining out 60 times a month - an average of twice a day. Even Indonesians dine out 15 times a month,"" said Kapil Chopra, president, The Oberoi Group.	Luxury hotel Sofitel in Mumbai has seen the ratio of room to F&B revenue change to 51:49 from 70:30 three years back. Biswajit Chakraborty, general manager of the property, says that a strong F&B element automatically gets good business for the rooms. ""If you enhance your F&B elements, locals constantly patronize your restaurants and hotel and bring room business too.""	The importance of F&B revenues has increased as profitability from room revenues has declined over the past decade in India. What seems to be driving this growth in F&B is a change in cultural trend of eating out often.	Hotels are aggressively promoting their F&B through discounts and offers to maintain their topline. In fact, new hotels across the country have come up with large meeting spaces and restaurants. Developers are including banqueting spaces in resorts in leisure locations too to attract MICE business.	Shrem Resorts-owned Novotel Hotel and Grand Mercure Hotel in Goa, for instance, together have 20,000 square feet of banquet space. Krishani Chhatwal, director of Shrem Resorts, says the company invested in importing a German hangar specifically for its banquet at Grand Mercure. ""It’s important to have banquets because that’s what drives business during the weekdays and summers,"" says Chhatwal, adding that revenue from F&B and banqueting has shot up by 30 per cent in 2015 over 2014. The properties host close to 25 events every month.	Moreover, with standalone restaurants giving upscale hotels a run for their money, hotels are trying to exploit the potential of this segment to the fullest and are coming up with newer ways to offer more than just good food and drinks."
"MUMBAI: Desi halwai and snacks maker Haldiram’s revenues grew 13% to cross Rs 4,000 crore in FY16 shrugging increased scrutiny from food regulator amid the Maggi crisis. The Indian snack major is now twice the size of Hindustan Unilever's packaged food division or Nestle Maggi and larger than the India turnover of the two American fast food rivals Domino’s and McDonald’s put together.  The company has three distinct areas of operations with Haldiram Snacks and Ethnic Foods with that clocked Rs 2,136 crore from the northern region, Nagpur based Haldiram Foods International that caters to western and southern markets with annual sales of Rs 1,613 crore and a much smaller company, Haldiram Bhujiawala, for the eastern market with revenues of Rs 298 crore in FY16, according to data from Tofler, a company research platform.  These figures, when combined with other regional snacking firms, conclusively demonstrates one thing — in fast food or munchies, despite the profusion of MNC brands with high cool quotient, good Indian palate prefers local savouries.                      “We have increased our reach and developed products in-house that ensure quality control. We also understand Indian palate well and that comes handy while launching new products,” says 43 year-old Kamal Agarwal, fourth generation member of the founding family.  The brand, that experts feel, could have more than Rs 5,000 crore in retail sales, has survived through disputes and break-ups in the original Agarwal family that started with a small shop in Bikaner in 1937.  Haldiram’s is the biggest brand of those launched by Agarwals and the second largest Indian food brand after Parle. While restaurants and casual dining was the beginning, packaged products now make up 80% of revenues. Haldiram’s is by far the market leader in traditional snacks market and bigger than five of its regional rivals — Balaji Wafers, Prataap Snacks, Bikanervala, Bikaji Foods and DFM Foods — combined.  “Food is culture in the country and Indian food should do well. But consumers are experimenting with food and it is under scrutiny. Companies would have to adapt and stay relevant especially for millennials,” said Devendra Chawla, Future Group president that has recently launched traditional aloo bhujia in peri peri, wasabi and schezwan flavours.  The snacks market is still dominated by western snacks such as potato chips and finger sticks controlled primarily by Pepsi Frito Lays and ITCNSE 3.15 % Foods. Even these companies are gradually entering into Haldiram’s turf. For instance, Pepsico’s Kurkure has 16 variants of Indian namkeen while Paper Boat will soon enter the category."
"NEW DELHI: Men’s bespoke clothing ecommerce firm Vitruvien aims to triple revenue through offline stores, according to its cofounder, Rajesh Goradia.  “Vitruvien’s turnover in 2014 was Rs1.5 crore. We are expecting to increase our revenue three times with our offline expansion,” Goradia told ET after inaugurating the company’s first pop-up store in CR2 mall in south Mumbai.  According to Goradia, the brand has been facing challenges with winning customer trust, ensuring product quality and reaching out to the portion of target buyers who haven’t adopted online shopping yet. “The conversion rate of our website is approximately 1%,” Goradia said.  Vitruvien, which plans to invest Rs 60-70 lakh in offline expansion in Mumbai, has signed a contract with CR2 mall to display its pop-up store for a year. “These are not temporary,” Goradia said, adding that the brand was in talks with four other malls in the city for similar annual contracts. “Permanent pop-up stores help in building higher recall value and trust quotient,” he said.  Pop-up stores are more cost-effective for a brand when compared with the overhead and rental costs involved in opening a brick-and-mortar outlet, according to him.  Before expanding to other cities, Vitruvien plans to concentrate on building its offline presence in Mumbai, where a majority of its customers are based. Vitruvien joins the growing trend of online-first brands—like FabAlley, Creyate and Freecultr—popping up offline with permanent-looking stores to boost consumer confidence and increase revenues."
"Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Retail more than doubled revenue during the year ended March, becoming the first retailer in India to cross the $10 billion sales mark. At ₹69,198 crore, Reliance Retail’s revenue in the previous financial year exceeded the combined sales of rivals Future Group, Avenue Supermart, Shoppers Stop and Tata Trent.However, with the fuel retailing business also contributing a chunk of Reliance’s organised retail business, the numbers are not comparable with rivals that run food and grocery supermarkets and lifestyle department stores.“We have established strong foundations in retailing and digital services business with world-class supply chain management and network infrastructure which will serve our customers well,” said Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance IndustriesNSE -0.27 %, which operates 3,837 stores with an area of over 17.7 million square feet.“It is very heartening to see the traction our service offerings are gaining, with discerning Indian consumers.

"MUMBAI: Flexible packaging major UflexNSE 0.95 % looks to target 30 per cent of its packaging segment's revenue from export markets in the next three years.  At present, exports account for 18-20 per cent of total revenue of its packaging business, Uflex Group President (Corporate FinanceNSE 1.68 % and Accounts) R K Jain told PTI.  The packaging business accounts for 44 per cent of total revenue of Uflex, which is also into production of chemicals, cylinders and holograms and engineering.  The company exports products to over 140 countries from its manufacturing units in India, Poland, the US, Mexico, Dubai and Egypt.  The packaging major has crossed the USD 1 billion revenue mark in India and wants to double its income to USD 2 billion in 4-5 years.  The company is setting up an aseptic packaging plant for liquid packaging in Sanand, Gujarat, with an investment of about Rs 580 crore in first phase and the total capacity will be 7 billion packs per annum.  ""The funding of the first phase, which has a capex of Rs 580 crore, was done partly through debt and partly through internal accrual,"" Jain said.  Uflex is investing in the next two years to enhance capacity for packaging semi-liquids and liquid materials and powder and granular material at Sanand.  ""The Sanand plant will produce liquid products such as energy drinks, milk and juices. About 90 per cent of the output from this factory will cater to the domestic market. After the Sanand plant becomes operational we will be present all packaging verticals,"" he said.  The first phase of the aseptic packaging plant will be commissioned by October 2016, and will be commercially operational by March-April 2017, in which around 250 persons will be employed, Jain said adding that on completion of all the phases the unit will generate employment for about 3,000 people."
"MUMBAI: Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) firms are expected to post a net revenue growth of 11.8 per cent in the March quarter, highest in the past 18 quarters, on acceleration in volume growth, GST-led savings and higher leverage benefits, said a report.However, the March quarter's performance isn't strictly comparable with the same quarter last year due to GST-led reporting changes and demonetisation impact in the base quarter, according to Kotak Institutional Equities.""At an aggregate level, we expect net revenue growth of 11.8 per cent, highest in the past 18 quarters. We expect 9.9 per cent growth for the staples pack, slightly lower than third quarter FY18's 11.2 per cent on a reported basis but higher on a base-adjusted basis,"" it said.The report estimated aggregate revenue growth for the discretionary pack at 13.5 per cent, while the aggregate volume growth at 8 per cent.It noted that companies have started increasing prices selectively to pass on raw material inflation after being cautious for the first few months post GST implementation.""Fourth quarter FY18 is thus likely to see higher price contribution than third quarter FY18,"" it said.Kotak Institutional Equities expects a 22 per cent growth over previous year for adjusted profit after tax, the highest since first quarter of FY13.It expects the long-anticipated volume growth uptick likely to show up, while margins, aided partly by GST, likely to expand further for most companies.""Overall, we expect a solid set of earnings prints for most companies. Even as volume growth numbers look weaker versus third quarter of FY18, the same needs to be adjusted for favourable demonetisation quarter base for third quarter of FY18, slightly adverse post-demonetisation quarter base for last quarter of FY18,"" it said.According to the report, while a scientific, mathematically-accurate, adjustment is not possible, the estimated fourth quarter FY18 volume growth numbers reflect acceleration in underlying volume growth trends in the sector.""This reflects share gains from the unorganised sector in the post-GST world to a large extent and uptick in rural demand to a smaller extent,"" it added.On margin expansion, it noted that even as higher pricing contribution, operating leverage and GST-led cost savings stand out as the key drivers, the broader view is of very benign competitive intensity in the market.Most food and beverages companies are expected to see good gross margin expansion given the stable to deflationary input cost scenario in agri commodities.""Price hikes should help mitigate gross margin pressure to some extent,"" it said."

Recent measures include the introduction of the e- visa facility under three categories of tourist, medical and business for the citizens of 163 countries, it added.Other initiatives include launch of global media campaign for 2017-18 on various channels, launch of 'The Heritage Trail' to promote the world heritage sites in India, launch of international media campaign on various international TV channels, it said.Another measure to promote tourism was celebration of 'Paryatan Parv' across the country from October 5 to 25, 2017 with three main components -- Dekho Apna Desh, Tourism for All, Tourism and Governance, the survey noted.""Outbound tourism has also picked up in recent years, with the number of departures of Indian nationals from India growing at 7.3 per cent during 2016 to 21.9 million from 20.4 million, in 2015,"" it said.This is more than double the foreign tourist arrivals in India, it added.In terms of number of domestic tourist visits, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka were the top five destination states, accounting for 61.3 per cent of total number of tourist visits in 2016, the survey said.Among centrally protected ticketed monuments for domestic visitors, Taj Mahal was the most visited monument in 2016 followed by Qutub Minar and Red Fort. While for foreign visitors, Taj Mahal was the most visited monument followed by Agra Fort and Qutub Minar, it added."
"BHUBANESWAR: A CAG report has said the Odisha Mining Corporation (OMC) lost an opportunity to earn revenue of Rs 1,838.98 crore as it could not achieve the targeted production of ores during 2012-17, despite having set a low target. The OMC had to fix its production target on the lower side due to non-availability of the required statutory clearances in time, the Comptroller and Auditor Generals' report tabled in the state assembly said yesterday. The failure to achieve the targeted production of ores resulted in a shortfall in the production of 114.45 lakh metric tonne of iron ore and 2.70 lakh metric tonne of chrome ore during 2012-2017, said the CAG report on public sector undertakings for the year ended March 2017. ""Consequently, the OMC lost an opportunity to earn revenue of Rs 1,838.98 crore during the period,"" it said. During 2012-17, there was a shortage in the closing stock of iron ore and chrome ore of 5.21 lakh metric tonne valued at Rs 146.01 crore, beyond the prescribed norm, the report said. The CAG report further said that OMC incurred avoidable expenditure of Rs 138.63 crore due to non-segregation of natural iron ore fines from the crushed iron ore fines. Delayed action to obtain forest clearance for mining purpose resulted in shortage of space for storing of ores in separate stacks, it said. Storage of ores in dump instead of separate stacks attracted higher rates of royalty payable to the central government, the report said. Consequently, the OMC incurred extra expenditure of Rs 110.79 crore towards royalty, the CAG said. Noting that the OMC failed to achieve the targeted sales in any of the years during 2012-17, it said the corporation could not recover royalty of Rs 37.28 crore from the buyers due to absence of suitable provision in the sales contract. The OMC also failed to install an iron ore handling plant, infrastructure facility and a mechanical evaluation system in its three major operating mines. Due to non-completion of the project, envisaged benefit of Rs 1189.97 crore per annum from two out of three projects could not be achieved, the CAG said. Stating that the OMC had not prepared long term corporate plan, vision and mission statements as required under corporate governance manual of Odisha Government, the CAG said in the absence of any long term corporate pan, the OMC could not develop strategies to achieve its objectives. Out of 34 mining leases, 26 were inoperative. Out of 26 inoperative mines, the OMC did not commence any mining operations in eight mines since inception, it said. ""Non-operation of mines resulted in unruitful expenditure of Rs 57.26 crore towards dead rent and watch ward expenses. Further, OMC retained four mines which did not have adequate ore reserves and incurred avoidable expenditure of Rs 112.85 crore,"" it said."
"MUMBAI: Robust domestic demand and rising need for complex products in the West will help domestic pharma players log in a 9 per cent revenue growth with healthy cash flows over the next three years, offsetting headwinds in exports and rising competition, says a report.""Revenue of domestic pharma companies is seen growing at 9 per cent per annum over the next three fiscal years ending 2020. Exports, which account for nearly 45 per cent of industry revenue, will see another year of a tepid one per cent growth in fiscal 2018, but recovering thereafter,"" Crisil said in a note today.Over half of the exports are to the regulated markets in the West but those are set to de-grow by 5 per cent this fiscal, after growing 3 per cent last fiscal.It attributes this to greater price erosion in existing products following competition, and delays in new product launches or import bans on existing products following scrutiny from the US food and drug administration.But the report sees this trend reversing with revenue growth from regulated markets gradually increasing to 7 per cent annually over the medium-term, augmenting overall exports growth to 6 per cent annually.This is contingent on faster product approvals by the US regulator, especially for complex products.""We are seeing successful resolution of regulatory actions from remediation efforts made over the past three years, even as regulatory scrutiny remains intense,"" the report noted. ""For instance, warning letters on nine domestic plants were resolved in the past 15 months, which is considerably higher than the four seen between fiscals 2013 and 2016,"" it added.Besides remediation efforts, companies are also increasing their research and development (R&D) spends to capitalise on the USD 20 billion-a-year complex products opportunity in the regulated markets.Crisil expects R&D spend to increase 700 basis points over fiscal 2017 to reach 30 per cent of annual revenue from the regulated markets over the medium-term.Another factor offsetting the export slowdown is the steady revenue growth from the domestic market, which accounts for 55 per cent of the industry revenue.""Strong demand will help firms maintain 10-11 per cent growth and healthy profitability, despite intense competition and frequent regulatory actions,"" says the report.Domestic demand growth will be backed by better access to healthcare, higher penetration of health insurance and increasing lifestyle diseases.Crisil rates over 300 domestic pharmaceutical firms, over 55 per cent of which have an international presence. Besides business strength and diversity, the credit profiles for most firms are backed by low reliance on debt. This is reflected in the credit ratio (upgrades to downgrades) exceeding 1.5 times for its pharma portfolio since fiscal 2015.Crisil believes these strong credit profiles will sustain and will be backed by healthy cash flows despite near-term challenges in the regulated markets."
"MUMBAI: US lifestyle and footwear brand Skechers said India could generate a billion dollar in revenues, helped by rapid expansion of stores and newer categories.“We do believe it (India) can be a multi-hundred million dollar country for us, maybe even close to a $1 billion for us as we take hold and build through what’s a massive population as the middle class grows,” David Weinberg, chief operating officer at Skechers said in an investors call. “Right now, we do less than $100 million there. I think $60 million to $70 million as far as India is concerned for the year,” he said.Skechers, which entered India in 2012 through a joint venture with Kishore Biyani-led Future Group, has been doubling its business and plans to add its own manufacturing units and newer categories. Globally, the retailer sells watches, apparels, socks and sunglasses among other merchandise. The brand opened nearly 30 stores over the past four months to take its total store count to over 120 outlets. The second-largest athletic footwear brand in the US, however, said volume is increasing, but at a fairly slow rate.“It’s a little more difficult to get started in India, but the brand is certainly resonating and our stores are certainly coping up. So we have increased: it was a nice size increase, certainly in the double-digits. They did turn profitable last year for the first time,” said Weinberg.Skechers is targeting highgrowth foreign markets to offset the weakness in the US market that has been growing in mid-single digit, against over 20% in most international markets. In India, it’s not an easy task — rival brands Reebok, Adidas, Nike and Puma — are much bigger in size and are also positioning their merchandise beyond lifestyle and cricket into products that can be associated with most sporting activities.With a rising sporting culture, growing number of sports clubs across the country and an increased emphasis on fitness, Euromonitor expects the sports footwear category to grow 19% CAGR between 2016-21. In 2016, overall sportswear recorded retail value growth of 22% to reach sales of Rs 36,000 crore, according to the researcher. At the same time, the share of online retailing in footwear continues to rise, jumping to 13% in 2016 from 1% in 2011."
"NEW DELHI: Indian Railways should look into innovative ways for revenue generation and closely monitor its expenditure, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has said in a report that was tabled in Parliament on Tuesday.""The operating ratio during 2016-17 had deteriorated to the lowest level of 96.5% since 2000-01 when it was 98.3%,” said the CAG report on railways finances for 2016-17.“Since, operating ratio is a direct indicator of the working of railways, the ministry of railways should also look into the various innovative ways for revenue generation and closely monitor the expenditure.""The report said the national transporter should revisit the passenger and other coaching tariffs so as to recover the cost of operations in a phased manner and reduce its losses in its core activities.""The fixation of passenger fare and freight charges should be based on the cost involved so that it brings both rationality and flexibility in pricing, considering the financial health of railways and the current market scenario. There is hardly any justification for not fully recovering the cost of passenger services in case of AC classes,"" the report said.It said the practice of issuing free and concessional tickets should be scaled down. Non-availability of sufficient funds in depreciation reserve fund to replace the over aged assets is indicative of weak financial health of the railways, the report said. The CAG highlighted huge backlog of renewal and replacement of over aged assets in the railway system, which needs to be addressed for safe running of trains. ""Railways should impress upon the budget controlling authorities for regular monitoring of expenditure,” the report said. “Internal control mechanism should be strengthened to reduce the instances of misclassification of expenditure. The unsanctioned expenditure should be controlled; administration should ensure all unsanctioned expenditure is regularised on priority."""
"NEW DELHI: Prominent malls are asking brands to either share revenues from their omnichannels operations or altogether stop such activities from their shopping centres.Select Citywalk and Pacific in Delhi and High Street Phoenix, Oberoi and InOrbit malls in Mumbai among those either incorporating such clauses in their rent agreements or objecting to retailers from carrying out omni-channel from malls.“Wherever we enter new agreements or go for renewals, we tell retailers, in case of any ecommerce activity with fulfilment happening from the store or if there is an order that happens from the store, we request for revenue share on the same principle as we do from stores,” said Anupam T, vice-president at Oberoi Mall in Mumbai. “If existing retailers don’t have permission for ecommerce, we don’t allow that. If the ecommerce is not defined clearly in the purpose of the agreement, then we can always restrict them.” Some malls even have a comprehensive ‘ecommerce policy’ that includes clauses like not using stores for warehousing online sales, maintaining price parity for products in the stores with online and barring brands from advertising online portals from the store fronts.“I am not sure if price parity clause will work,” said Abhishek Bansal of Pacific Mall in West Delhi that is introducing omni-channel revenue clause in new agreements. “Even if you write (in the agreement) that there is no way to control it.” These are various measures malls are undertaking to defend their turfs from the ecommerce onslaught, retailers say. Brands are frowning. “There are certain malls that are okay with omni-channel as they are getting revenue from it,” said the head of a global brand that has stores in all the top malls. “Then there are certain malls that see us as a competition and they are restricting us from delivering from our stores.”Also, malls are asking for share in revenue on any sales emanating from the digital kiosk that retailer put in the outlets even if the real sales is happening online and store is not even involved in the delivery. “Sales from such digital kiosks from our mall should be counted as sales from the mall and they should share revenue with us,” said a senior executive at a top mall that is incorporating such clauses.Rajneesh Mahajan, CEO at Inorbit Malls in Mumbai, said some brands have approached the mall management seeking permission for undertaking omnichannel and given their models on how to share revenues."
"NEW DELHI: Railways earned an additional Rs 2,000 crore through sale of tickets in 2016-2017 as compared to the previous fiscal, the government told Parliament today.Minister of State for railways Rajen Gohain told Lok Sabha that in 2015-2016, the national transporter earned Rs 17,204.06 crore through booking of tickets online and Rs 28,119 crore in offline booking while in 2016-2-017, it earned 19,209.28 crore in online booking and 28,468.81 crore in offline booking.The revenue generated through tickets in 2015-2016 was Rs 45,323.93 crore while in the corresponding period next year it increased by Rs 2354.16 crore.This refers to the fiscal year ending March 2017.""With a view to facilitating convenient booking of unreserved tickets by passengers without having to stand in long queues to purchase railway tickets, Indian Railways has introduced facility of booking paperless unreserved tickets, season ticket and platform ticket through mobile phone in some stations in Central, Western, Eastern, Southern, South Eastern, South Central and Northern Railways"", Gohain said."
"KOLKATA: Tata SteelNSE -0.38 % Ltd is bullish on its home solution products, aiming at sales of Rs 1,000 crore from this segment over the next years, a senior company official said.""Our revenue from the retail interior steel home solutions in the current fiscal will be about Rs 200 crore.

Doors alone have the potential to post Rs 1,000 crore a year revenue in future, with the rise in construction activities, he said.The windows business will gather momentum as the products come with a premium look, and at a price which will be ""half of the competition"", he said.""We are contemplating launching products for main gates of houses, but nothing has firmed up yet. We only launch products that come with full installation support,"" the official added."
"NEW DELHI: Banking on growing domestic tourism, foreign tourist arrivals, airline passenger numbers as well as muted supply growth, hotel chains and sector experts predict 2018 to result in better room revenues and profit margins than in the year that just ended.The past year saw the start of an uptrend in the hospitality sector, but was also marked by multiple challenges like curbs on liquor sale and the GST rollout. With these issues behind them, hotel operators expect business growth to pick up momentum in 2018.Demonetisation and the ban on liquor sales within 500 meters of highways had affected MICE (meeting, incentive, conference and exhibition) activities and the food and beverages segment, said Pavethra Ponniah, vice president at ratings firm ICRA. “As active supply pipeline — especially the hotels which are nearing completion — is still narrow across most cities, we expect the industry growth to pick up significantly starting financial year 2019. By then, domestic demand would have fully recovered from the temporary blips witnessed due to demonetisation and the GST rollout.”Going by recent trends in foreign tourist arrivals and forex earnings growth, and improving domestic macroeconomic data — barring a transitory dip in economic activities due to demonetisation and GST — ICRA expects improvement in average room rates across most markets in India. “We expect corporate request for proposal rates for the current year to increase by about 5%,” Ponniah said.More than 10 million foreign tourists arrived in India in 2017 and the country is estimated to have earned $27 billion from them.Chains like Accor, ITCNSE 3.15 % Hotels and Lemon Tree said the business outlook for 2018 was optimistic based on the current performance trends at both business and leisure locations.“Markets across the country are looking strong, leaving some markets like Kolkata which are oversupplied. Demand in high-occupancy markets like Mumbai, Delhi, Gurgaon, Bengaluru and Pune will continue to peak, which is an opportunity for rates,” said Arif Patel, AccorHotels India’s vice president for sales, marketing and distribution loyalty. “In 2018, for AccorHotels India, we are looking at double-digit revenue per available room growth — 60% to 70% of which will come from the average daily rates,” he said.Patel said the company would post better revenue and profit margin this year.According to sector experts, India finally surpassed the 65% occupancy rates threshold in 2017, with revenue per available room growth of 4.2% (2.9% from occupancies and 1.7% from average daily rates).Consulting firm HVS estimated that occupancy of branded hotels hit a decade-high rate of 65.6% in financial year ended March 2017, compared with 63.3% in fiscal 2016. The last time India reported occupancy rates of about 65% was in fiscal 2008.“The 2018 outlook is premised on the following data points — continued strong growth rates in foreign tourist arrivals (and) airline passenger movement coupled with muted supply growth. The settling down of business sectors to all the new initiatives rolled out in 2017 and growing demand from the domestic market segment will add further impetus,” said Dipak Haksar, the chief executive of ITC Hotels and WelcomHotels.Hotel chains expect most of the growth to come from higher room rates. Lemon Tree Hotels chairman Patu Keswani said the demand-supply imbalance, skewed towards demand, was expected to stay so, resulting in higher occupancies in the hotel sector and giving the players confidence to raise prices.“We expect the rates to go up by 10% for our hotels. Demand continues to grow. It will grow much faster than supply this year,” said an executive at a global hotel chain."
"HYDERABAD: Bengaluru-based amusement parks operator WonderlaNSE -2.52 % Holidays aims to increase the share of the non-ticketing segment in its revenues by introducing newer digital facilities like ewallets, a top executive said.  “We aim to increase the share of non-ticketing revenues to 40% from the current 26.9% in the next three-four years by introducing newer digital technology facilities like e wallets, which have helped us register higher revenues from the non-ticketing segment apart from introducing newer range of merchandises and increasing our food and beverage offerings,” said Arun K Chittilappilly, managing director of Wonderla Holidays.

"NEW DELHI: The system of coalblocks allocation could undergo an overhaul, with New Delhi leaning towards the oil-and-gas industry model that involves sharing production or revenue instead of the existing practice of auctions.The coal ministry has set up an expert committee to examine challenges facing the current bidding system and to suggest changes to the process for conducting future auctions of coal mines, officials familiar with the development told ET.The committee will be headed by former chief vigilance commissioner Pratyush Sinha, and former State Bank of India chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya and exchief of Union Bank of India will be members of the panel. Industry experts say the new system is likely to generate much more enthusiasm in the corporate sector than the prevailing procedure of auctions, which helped clean up the process of allocation but received a tepid response from companies.Former food processing industries secretary Rakesh Kacker, a 1977 batch IAS officer of Tamil Nadu cadre, is also part of the committee. Between March 2004 and February 2007, Kacker advised the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India on issues relating to radio and broadcasting. Prior to that, he handled facilitation of private investment in the power sector. Between June 1994 and 1996, he worked in the PMO on issues relating to finance and energy.In a five-year stint between 1985 and 1990 in the oil ministry, Kacker handled issues relating to production, transportation and pricing of natural gas.The expert panel, with representations from Niti Ayog, DIPP and coal ministry, will examine the present bid system, study its challenges “and compare its merits and demerits vis-à-vis the production/revenue-sharing model,” an official said.The panel will also suggest changes in the bid process in its report to be submitted within a month. The formation of the committee follows an advisory by a government department to the coal ministry, pointing out the annulment of the last two tranches of coal mine auctions due to tepid response from the industry. The fourth and fifth rounds of coal-mine auctions to non-power firms have been shelved as companies were not too keen. The present coal mine auction mechanism has become provided under the Coal Mines Special Provisions Act and the amended Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation Act.The procedure, laid down under the Coal Block Allocation Rules introduced by the NDA government, provides for reverse online auctions for power projects and forward bidding for other uses. After the cancellation of all mining leases by the Supreme Court in 2014, the government auctioned 17 operational mines and allotted 18 such blocks to government companies, data received by ET from the coal ministry showed.Of these 35 blocks that were operational at the time of allocation,15 have resumed mining. Out of 49 mines that were scheduled to begin mining from June 2018, three have started functioning ahead of time, the data showed.“The production in the year 2016-17 from the auctioned/allotted operational coal mines is 15.3 million tonnes as compared to production of 15.8 million tonnes from these coal mines in the FY 2014-15 i.e. prior to cancellation of allocation of these coal mines,” the coal ministry said in response to an emailed query from ET.However, the overall captive coal mine production has dropped as a number of blocks that were once operational are yet to resume mining. The major reasons for the delay in operations have been legal issues and lack of green clearances.“Action has already been initiated against the 5 non-operational auctioned coal mines. Further, show-cause notices for 15 allotment coal mines have been issued for deviation from the scheduled timeline. Of these 15 blocks, 6 allotted coal blocks have not been operationalised because of legal hurdles relating to mine development organisations. The remaining 9 blocks are expected to start production in the year 2018-19,” the coal ministry said.Also, of the eight power companies that were allocated coal blocks, five have moved court to challenge the government’s decision to disallow pass-through of quoted discount on coal costs in the final power tariff."
"New Delhi: Sterlite Power Friday said it has signed an agreement for Pampa transmission project in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, entailing an investment of Rs 1,394.79 crore.""The agreement is for batch 13, won at energy transmission auction held by ANEEL ( Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency),"" Sterlite Power said in a statement.Completion of the project is expected in March 2023, and signing of the pact represents an important milestone in the company's evolution, it added.The company however said it will ensure ahead of schedule delivery just like other projects in India.The project includes construction of three energy transmission lines totalling 316 km, two substations and 1,544 MVA transformation capacity, with annual allowed revenue of 74.72 million Brazilian real ( about Rs 133.98 crore) and an investment of 777.8 million Brazilian real (about Rs 1,394.79 crore).""Given the strong contractual framework, including long concession tenures (30 years) and inflation-protected revenues (which help lower the forex risk), the Brazil market presents us with a clear vision to implement projects in a time bound manner. We hope to replicate our successes in India in Brazil too,"" said Ved Mani Tiwari, CEO - Global Infrastructure Business, Sterlite Power.Sterlite Power develops power transmission infrastructure and has projects exceeding 12,500 km in circuits and 20,500 MVA in India and Brazil."
"Leading electronic security systems player Zicom today said it is looking at significant growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) and SaaS market place to clock a service revenue of about Rs 200 crore by 2020.  ""Zicom has moved from being a pure play, physical security company into an IoT and SaaS IT Services business model. With the exponential internet penetration growing in the country, Zicom is all set to take full advantage to become the market leader within the Internet of Things (IoT) and SaaS place,"" Zicom Electronic Security SystemsNSE -1.19 %' managing director Pramoud Rao told PTI here.  ""We have notched up a revenue of around Rs 50 crore in fiscal 2017 and expect to reach service revenue of Rs 175 crore to Rs 200 crore by 2020,"" he said.  ""We are now looking at new avenues to grow the business by adopting newer technologies, like artificial intelligence. We are also investing in deep learning in the domain of access control as well as towards introducing voice-based security services under the Amazon, Alexa platform,"" Rao said.  The IoT market continues to see strong growth. The worldwide IoT market spend will grow from USD 625.2 billion in 2015 to USD 1.29 trillion in 2020, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.6 per cent, he said.  The installed base of IoT end points will grow from USD 12.1 billion at the end of 2015 to more than USD 30 billion by 2020. The Indian security industry is in a state of big transition due to SaaS, IoT, smart city and safe city trends, he further said.  In 2013, the company identified the potential of IoT business and started taking steps towards gaining leadership in the IoT space. It has set up the country's largest command and control centre with service network in over 1,100 cities.  The approach was to provide business intelligence together using safety and security, club it with loss prevention features combined with comfort and convenience, offering information on the mobile devises, Rao said.  The Indian security market in 2017, according to Gartner, is growing at the rate of 10.6 per cent, from USD 1.24 billion and the number of connected devices in India is estimated to be around USD 200 million. This is expected to increase USD 3 billion in 2020.  Hence, it augurs well for the security market in India and players like Zicom will have major role to play in the coming years, he said.  Since the business model offers considerable cost reduction, without the customer having to invest or manage the equipment, Zicom's pioneering concept met up with huge success since the USP offered by the company was a huge paradigm shift within the security industry, namely CCTVs systems always recorded a crime, Zicom prevented the crime, from reactive to being proactive, Rao said.  In the case of ATM e-surveillance, the cost of managing an ATM was averaging between Rs 30,000 to Rs 40,000 for the bank. By using the e-surveillance technology, the cost was reduced to a mere Rs 4,000. This saved the bank almost 90 per cent on the safety and security cost, he added."
"With six months to go for the 11th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL), the new rights holder, Star India, has started working on its go-to-market strategy.  The Rupert Murdoch-owned company, which acquired the global media rights of the league for an eye-popping 16,347.5 crore, is looking at garnering close to 1,500 crore from television ad sales and about 200-300 crore from advertising on Hotstar, its video-on-demand service.  In the previous season, the incumbent rights holder, Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN), had recovered over 1,300 crore from ad sales, while from digital Hotstar (Star India had digital rights for the IPL then) had managed to earn close to 120 crore.  Industry and company sources have informed ET that Star India has altered the sales structure and a project focused ad revenue team has been nominated. Helmed by two vice presidents — Atul Gandhi and Vaibhav Goyal — the team will have 6-8 managers. This team is empowered and will be responsible for the IPL-related ad sales.  An email query sent to Star India did not elicit any response till the time of going to press.  It seems that the steep demand on revenue has made Star India depart from the account-based manning structure and go instead for a wider, all-encompassing mandate. According to a top executive of a media agency, this team will effectively be responsible for revenues exceeding the total ad sales of Star Sports’ rest of portfolio put together.  “Sony did a great job of selling IPL, and to better that, Star will have to start soon,” the media planner, who did not wish to be identified, said.  Another media planner said that the clients will be in wait-and-watch mode.  “The market is already abuzz, but clients will not start signing cheques just yet. Yes, IPL is a pioneering league and also the most successful one. But the return on investment is a worry. I can comment more once the rates are out,” he said.  It‘s important to note that after 10 seasons, this is the first time that India television, digital, and International television will be with the same company.  In an earlier interaction, Uday Shankar, CEO, Star India, had told ET that advertisers are ready to pay a premium for impact properties. “The market has clearly stepped up. Premium assets are getting very high inflation, while the discounted end of the market is getting even more discounted,” he had said.  However, industry experts point out that the market is aware of Star’s steep revenue aspirations or compulsions and dramatic rate revisions are a real possibility. It has already been tried and met with mixed results. While it held the rates, sales suffered.  “Star was asking for Rs 10 lakh per 10 seconds for the India Australia series, but advertisers were not willing to pay that much. I believe they have not met the targets for the India-New Zealand series as well,” said a planner quoted above.  As per industry experts, Star India was targeting close to Rs 330-340 crore from the India-Australia series and Rs 125-135 crore from the India-New Zealand series. Sources said that both the targets were missed by close to Rs 100 crore and Rs 70 crore, respectively.  “It becomes a question of what Star will do with IPL as an offering itself,” he added."
"By Smriti Basnet  Swedish direct-selling cosmetics brand Oriflame is aiming to generate Rs 1,000 crore in revenue from India in the next fiscal year as it sees strong growth in demand in tier-II and III cities.  Oriflame India, the wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, reported revenue of over Rs 600 crore in 2014-15.  “In the last 5-7 years, these towns and cities have really come up strongly,” said Prachi Mohapatra, senior manager-brand & communciation, South Asia, at Oriflame India. “There is strong word-of-mouth communication. People are getting exposed to more brands than before and these are not only limited to brands that are advertised.”  The company said its distributor base is also expanding fast in smaller towns and cities. ”Distributors in these towns and cities grow multiple times faster than in bigger cities. We support women having their own business and disposable income, which is why we are growing strongly in tier-II and III cities and towns,” said Mohapatra.  According to the company, 95% of its distributors in India are women.  Oriflame, which will complete two decades in India this year, markets 400 products in the country. It has branches in 18 cities.  Earlier this year, the company entered the wellness segment with vegetarian products, customised especially for the Indian market. “India has been a really huge market for us. We are investing a lot to customise products across wellness, skin care and colour cosmetics categories here,” added Mohapatra.

"KOLKATA: Reliance Jio Infocomm, which is expected to start telecom services in April, is slated to notch up annual revenue of $6.69 billion (Rs 45,492 crore) by the end of its fourth year of commercial operations and corner 23% of India’s non-voice market, brokerage Morgan Stanley said.    “We expect Reliance Jio’s pan-India launch by April 2016 as the company mentioned all regulatory compliance measures are in place,” Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients, a copy of which was reviewed by ET.  The US brokerage estimates Jio will generate $1.7 billion of revenue by the end of 2016-17, which will be its first year of commercial operations if it starts in April. Morgan Stanley’s optimism stems from Jio boosting its 4G coverage prospects in the premium 850 MHz band after signing airwave trading and sharing pacts with Reliance Communications in nine and 17 circles.  The brokerage expects Jio to target as many as 131 million customers by end-2019-20. It said the company’s 4G network “in the 1800/2300 MHz bands is ready” and it is expanding its 850 MHz footprint through the recent spectrum trading and sharing deals with RCom. Since “RCom has applied for spectrum liberalisation in the 850 MHz band, Jio will be able to get the spectrum in 45 days when its files with the telecom department for related permission,” Morgan Stanley said.  Brokerage CLSA said Reliance Jio is equipped to offer “the best 4G coverage by virtue of its pan-India footprint, unlike incumbents Bharti Airtel, Idea and Vodafone, which have 4G presence in only 15, 12 and five circles, respectively. Bharti Airtel, the No. 1telco, posted revenue of Rs 92,000 crore last year and has rolled out 4G in more than 350 towns and cities. Vodafone India and Idea are launching their 4G high-speed broadband services in select markets.  According to CLSA, “Vodafone is in the most delicate situation among the top-three incumbents with 5 MHz of 4G spectrum in only four of its top-10 markets that form 74% of its revenues.” It expects some 20 million Vodafone India customers to switch over to Jio and as many as 15 million and 10 million from Airtel and Idea, respectively, once the telecom unit of Reliance Industries launches 4G services commercially.  In a recent note, CLSA said Jio would grab 80 million high-value data customers from urban markets in two years and predicted over 55% of them would come from rivals Vodafone, Airtel and Idea. Analysts at CLSA said Jio and Airtel are “favourably placed to offer both coverage and capacity on 4G” as they have spectrum in the 1800 MHz and 2300 MHz bands."

"NEW DELHI: From a mere outpost for top automakers exploring virgin growth territories in Asia, India has emerged as the major revenue generator for global brands such as Suzuki and Honda, replicating the success of the local units of transnational cement and consumer-goods giants.  Maruti Suzuki’s contribution to the global sales of its Japanese parent Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC) breached the halfway mark in the first six months of FY18. And Suzuki’s rival across the Sea of Japan, Hyundai, has also benefited from its early exposure to the country.  Hyundai’s sales in India accounted for about 15% of the group’s total volumes between January and October this year, up from 13.5% in 2015 and ahead of Europe, although the South Korean company came to the country about a decade and a half after Suzuki partnered New Delhi to revolutionise personal transport in South Asia.  Cars are not the only beneficiaries of the consumption boom in Asia’s third-biggest economy, which is also among the world’s fastest expanding. India-based units of Suzuki Motorcycle and Honda Motorcycle make up a third of global sales at their parent companies.  Data on Suzuki’s global Web site show that Maruti Suzuki’s share in the total increased to a record of 54.4% in the second quarter of FY18, up from 49.5% recorded at the end of FY17. The compact-car company expects India to contribute even more.  “India is the fastest-growing automobile market in the world. It is an important market (for Suzuki) and to this end, it has been making investments in capacity, being future-ready (by bringing in electric vehicles).  If the Indian market continues to grow and Maruti SuzukiNSE 2.16 % continues to increase its market share, sales contribution from India will go up even further in the years ahead,” Maruti Suzuki Chairman R C Bhargava told ET.  Maruti Suzuki’s sales have increased 17% (to around 826,000 units) to outpace Suzuki’s performance in Japan, where volumes grew 7.2% in the first half of the fiscal.  Hyundai India would soon launch two masssegment models – an entry-level hatch in 2018, and a compact SUV in 2019. It expects growth in India to accelerate further.  “India is one of the most important markets for Hyundai globally, and our contribution is going up… With new products coming in, we expect an increase in our market share as well as our contribution to the world map,” said Rakesh Srivastava, director (sales and marketing), HMIL.  India has, in recent months, also emerged as the largest market for two-wheelers for Suzuki and Honda Motor Company (HMC). Suzuki Motorcycle India (SMIPL) and Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India (HMSI) have contributed about a third to global sales.  Yadvinder Singh Guleria, senior V-P, (sales &marketing), HMSI, said: “Honda is not only driving the Indian industry momentum but also leading Honda’s global two-wheeler business, which is conducted in more than 120 countries. India is the No. 1 market for Honda’s two-wheeler business worldwide.”  Booming India demand prompted Japan’s third-largest automaker Honda to raise its global motorcycles sales target for the year earlier this month. With a 17.7% (H1FY18) growth, Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India contributed about 32% to HMC’s global twowheeler sales volumes in the first six months of this fiscal year, up from 25%in FY16."

It had clocked an advertising revenue of Rs 1,000 crore from IPL 8.  ""We have had a 20 per cent growth in revenue.

The other presenting sponsors- Vodafone and Amazon- bought 210 seconds per match. Oppo, Maruti, Coca-Cola, Tata Sky were some of the new brands that came on board this year, Gupta said.  ""This year, handset category and the e-commerce categories were the two big ones. Handset contributed about 23-24 per cent, and e-commerce was about 17-18 per cent of our advertising revenues,"" he said.  SPN also has the rights for the UEFA Euro 2016 football championship which will be held in France from June 10 to July 10. The broadcaster has sold about 70 per cent of its inventory for this event.  ""Football is the next big thing. We have been able to establish a rate of over Rs 2 lakh for 10 seconds for Euro. We have got Gionee as the title sponsor. Football is starting to see a lot of traction now amongst advertisers, especially brands which are targeting the youth,"" Gupta said."

"MUMBAI: Starbucks Corp., the world’s largest coffee retailer, posted its slowest sales growth in India last year, likely indicating that its novelty factor is waning as it focuses on profitability and halts aggressive expansion.Tata Starbucks, the unit in India formed in partnership with the Tata Group, clocked net sales of Rs 272 crore, a growth of 14%, during the year ended March 2017 and narrowed losses to Rs 32 crore, according to filings with the Registrar of Companies. A year ago, it had posted sales of Rs 239 crore with a net loss of Rs 41 crore.With 91 stores until March, a back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that each Starbucks shop sold coffee, snacks and merchandise worth Rs 3 crore. That’s three times higher than bigger rival Coffee Day Enterprises, which runs the country’s top coffeehouse chain, Cafe Coffee Day, and had retail revenue of Rs 1,423 crore from 1,682 outlets, or about Rs 84 lakh annual sales per store.Jubilant FoodWorks, which runs Dunkin’ Donuts and Domino’s Pizza in India, clocked Rs 2.16 crore per store. Westlife Development, the operator of McDonald’s in west and south India, had revenue of Rs 3.6 crore per store on an average.According to experts, Starbucks’ performance in India has stabilised after initial years of high growth.“India is a price-sensitive market, where brands have their own cycle of growth. With new region entry, global brands get high attention, which later stabilises. Starbuck’s premium pricing is also a challenge for opening stores at newer locations,” said Ruchi Sally, director at retail consultancy Elargir Solutions.“We’ve taken a focused and disciplined approach to building Tata-Starbucks since entering India in 2012. Our partners (employees) have been the core to our success through the unparalleled customer experience and coffee craftsmanship which has earned the trust and respect of Indian consumers. We continue to see balanced growth in our business and are committed to the market over the long-term,” said Sumitro Ghosh, CEO at Tata Starbucks.Globally, consolidated net revenue at Starbucks grew 8% to $5.7 billion in the quarter ended July 2. The company had 26,736 stores across 75 countries.Starbucks, which started in India in October 2012, recorded the fastest store expansion in the company’s 45-year history in the initial few years. The Indian unit of the Seattle-based company opened almost 75 stores until 2015 and has added 16 cafes since then in a market that’s been subdued, with consumers not eager to spend amid economic uncertainty.Also, for global coffee chains including Starbucks, consumers are attuned to a takeaway culture, which helps them add margins at very little cost. In India, however, office-goers and students go to cafes to relax and spend hours over coffee and snacks. Real estate costs in India are high, making it important for retailers that average price realisation per square foot of space. Starbucks has been losing about Rs 35 lakh on each store on an average, although it has almost halved from two years ago.After more than two years of dull growth, quick-service restaurants are now seeing double-digit sales growth, helped by a surge in discount-driven footfalls at malls and greater presence in new markets.Starbucks expanded its partnership with Tata Group beyond India by launching the latter’s single-origin coffee in the US and Himalayan mineral water in Singapore a year ago."
"NEW DELHI: Ratings agency ICRANSE -0.42 % has forecast that non-aeronautical revenues at Indian airports will grow by 16.6 per cent to touch Rs 16,150 crore over the next 10 years, driven by increase in scope of activities there and growing commercial orientation of the operators.  Revenues from such activities primarily consist of fees for the rights to operate businesses at the airport, and rental of leased land and premises.  Some of the common non-aeronautical activities include food and beverage business, duty-free shops, leasing of terminal space, and running car rentals/parking and hotels/motels.  Over the last 10 years, non-aeronautical revenues at domestic airports have increased at a CAGR of 22.9 per cent -- from Rs 450 crore in fiscal 2005 to Rs 3,500 crore in 2014-15, according to ICRA.  Over the next 10 years, ICRA estimates that the per passenger non-aeronautical revenue for Indian airports would grow from the current levels of Rs 182 to Rs 410, at a CAGR of 8.4 per cent, the ratings firm said in its forecast, released today.  ""The total non-aeronautical revenues at Indian airports are expected to reach Rs 16,150 crore in FY2025 at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 16.6 per cent,"" it said.  Significantly, ICRA's projections comes at a time when Indian carriers have reportedly sought a ban on the sale of liquor in the security hold area (SHA) at domestic terminals of airports on the ground that drunk passengers on board can be a ""safety threat.""  At presenet, sale of liquor is allowed both at shops and pubs inside the SHA at airports after passengers have checked-in and undergone the security check.  Noting that over the years, airports have evolved from being purely an infrastructure provider to a sophisticated market entity with diversified revenue streams, ICRA said, ""this has led to the emergence of non-aeronautical revenues which have become a key contributor to an airport's revenues.""  ""As many international airports have evolved over the years in terms of generation of non-aeronautical revenues, the same can be expected from the Indian airports.  ""The increase in scope of activities at the airports and growing commercial orientation of the airport operators are expected to drive the growth in non-aeronautical revenues at Indian airports,"" ICRA AVP for corporate ratings, Harsh Jagnani said.  Non-aeronautical revenues constitute 25 per cent of the total revenues for Indian airports, whereas their contribution stands at 37 per cent for the ICRA Sample of international airports.  On a per PAX basis, the non-aeronautical revenue in India stands at Eur 2.52 (for FY2015), which is significantly lower than Eur 5.80 for the ICRA Sample of international airports, Jagnani said.  For this purpose, ICRA has analysed 25 international airports/airport groups together encompassing 132 airports and including 21 of the 50 busiest airports in the world, with a total passenger base of 1,700 million and non-aeronautical revenues in excess of Eur 11 billion."
"MUMBAI: Banks and digital payments processors, such as Visa, MasterCard and RuPay, are expected to lose over Rs1,000 crore in revenue between November and December as the merchant discount rate (MDR) on the usage of debit cards at PoS (point of sale) transactions has been waived till December 31.  Currently, for transactions below Rs2,000, a merchant pays the acquirer bank 0.75% MDR, while for transactions above Rs2,000, he shells out 1%. The acquirer bank (the one issuing the swipe machine) then pays 0.6% of its share to the card-issuing bank. The payment processors make anything between six and eight basis points on these transactions from acquirer and issuing banks.  The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) also collects 60 paise from card-issuing banks and 30 paise from the bank that issues the swipe machine.As per the latest numbers from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the collective value of debit and credit card transactions at ATMs and PoS was Rs2.62 lakh crore in September, and according to an estimate, banks and payment processors make around 1% on transactions at PoS terminals.  The amount merchants pay to the acquirer bank as a share of the transaction value at PoS terminals stood at Rs160 crore in September.  Several banks have said that PoS transactions have gone up three times post ban on high-denomination notes on November 8 and the consequent cash crunch in the system. But because of a recent directive from the RBI, banks will not get MDR from merchants till December 31. The NPCI was first to waive the charges on RuPay debit cards until the year-end. There are currently 1.5 million PoS terminals installed across the country, and another one million terminals are expected to be installed over the next six months.  “Our philosophy is to promote all aspects of payments, and there will be a healthy balance between cash and non-cash,” said Loney Antony managing director Hitachi Payments Services. “All options should be made available to consumers and the choice should be left to him.”"

"NEW DELHI: The automotive sector is expected to generate up to $300 billion in annual revenue by 2026, contributing over 12 per cent to the nation’s gross domestic product and creating 65 million more jobs, shows a document prepared jointly by the industry and government.  The Automotive Mission Plan 2016-26 seeks to make the automotive industry the engine of the 'Make in India' initiative. It was unveiled on Wednesday amid concerns that high taxes and the absence of key reforms like the goods and service tax in a sluggish economy could prove to be major impediments to growth.  Nevertheless, the document projects India’s automotive industry to grow to over 70 million units a year by 2026, taking it into the league of China and the US. The AMP is aimed at mapping the progress of the country’s automobile industry and setting its goals over the next decade. Around 23 million vehicles were produced in India in the year ended on March 31, 2015. The industry is estimated to be worth $74 billion now. “I think a little too ambitious, if we look at the current infrastructure situation,” Rakesh Batra of Ernst & Young said, referring to the targets.  The second Automotive Mission Plan unveiled by the Society of Indian Automotive Manufactures has targets for various segments of the industry, in terms of size and contribution to the economy. The first vision document was for the period 2006-2016. “The biggest challenge (to achieve the aim) is going to be of infrastructure. In India, the second biggest cost that we have to bear is in logistics and transportation, which is about 15 per cent,” said Ravindra Pisharody, executive director, commercial vehicles, at Tata Motors. “However, the projection made is quite achievable.”      According to SIAM, the industry has been able to achieve the larger targets of the first edition of the AMP. The key achievements are investments in excess of Rs 1,60,000 crore and creation of jobs – the target is 35 million by the end of 2016. Besides, the industry is on course to hit the base-case target of Rs 5,49,000 crore revenue. Speaking at SIAM’s annual convention in New Delhi, its president, Vikram Kirloskar, highlighted the potential of the industry, but also the risks it is facing.  “There are speed breakers in the form of slow government policies with no clear roadmap on GST and high taxes imposed on the auto industry … the cumulative burden of taxes to customers on cars goes up to 84 per cent, making the industry highly uncompetitive,” he said.  Others raised concerns over delayed reforms. Mahindra & Mahindra Executive Director Pawan Goenka said political stalemate was pushing several initiatives and this could derail economic recovery. Hero MotoCorp Chairman Pawan Munjal said: “We hope the government policy frame should improve in tune with time as we move ahead and is move in the right direction in the long-term with key reforms being addressed at the earliest.”  To achieve the new targets, the government must deliver on its promises, such as on ease of doing business, said YS Guleria, senior vice president for sales and marketing at Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India."

"KOLKATA: Sony India revenue growth remained flat in the just concluded 2016-17 fiscal with the Japanese consumer electronics maker yet to overcome the impact of its exit from the laptop and mass market smartphones markets, though it held hopes of pulling things back this fiscal, said managing director Kenichiro Hibi.  “Our revenue growth was flat in FY17 due to the high base effect of laptop and mobile phone businesses. However, if we consider just the television business, revenue grew by 20 per cent last fiscal.This fiscal, we are targeting 20 per cent revenue growth at a company level since the effect of laptop and mobile business has flattened out,“ he said.  Data accessed from the company's regulatory filCOR ing with the Registrar of SCOR Companies reveal that its turnover in FY16 was Rs. 8073.33 crore.  Sony India's pace of revenue growth was impacted for the second consecutive fiscal due to a change in strategy of its parent that prompted it to exit the laptop business."
"After this bid, I don’t have money to take you guys out for lunch,” Uday Shankar, CEO, Star India, joked with his colleagues on Monday, just after winning global media rights of the Indian Premier League for the next five years. Star India won media rights for Rs 16,347.5 crore — stumping a dozen other technology, media and telecom giants — with its global composite bid. Later, in an internal communication to his staff, Shankar says, “It is in the DNA of this great company to take very few, but very big, risks and then go about executing them relentlessly in a very disciplined manner.”  And while it is a very big risk — Rs 54.5 crore per match — a back-of-the-envelope calculation based on long discussions with experts from media, distribution and the sports industry shows that Star India may earn Rs 18,000-20,000 crore in the next five years from IPL. Many in the industry say the task is challenging, but it’s not impossible to make money, even at this price.  “While it will make losses in the first two years, on a five-year horizon, it may recover the cost and make money too,” adds a sports marketing executive.  Those backing the optimistic case say IPL is the single largest and most impactful media property in India, one that has been attracting very high viewership across demographics, every single day for 50 days for the last 10 years.  To put things into perspective, there are three revenue streams — television advertising, distribution (payout from cable and DTH operators to the broadcaster) and digital (advertising and subscription). As Star India has won the global rights, it will also be able to syndicate its rights in territories where it does not have a presence.      Revenue Potential from TV Ads Incumbent television rights holder, Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN), clocked advertising revenue of Rs 1,300 crore from IPL10 (2017), compared to Rs 400 crore in the first year (2008).  Advertising revenue has seen year-on-year growth, except in 2013, when the total number of matches were reduced. In the digital space, revenues have more than doubled every year in the past three years, with Hotstar clocking Rs 150 crore from digital advertising in IPL10.  “Advertisers have been paying a premium for IPL and they will have to continue to pay. Even at a 20% increase over the current figure, it will get Rs 8,000-10,000 crore from advertising alone (over five years),” says Sandeep Goyal, founder, Mogae Group.      A typical IPL match has ad inventory of 2,300 seconds. In IPL10, SPN raised spot rates by 15% to Rs 6.25 lakh per 10 seconds, which did not deter advertisers. Among sponsors, co-presenting sponsors paid Rs 5.2 lakh for 10 seconds, while associate sponsors’ payout was at Rs 5.75 lakh.  Nandini Dias, chief executive at media agency Lodestar UM India, feels that because of the sort of bid it has made, Star will have to increase ad rates by over 200% — or Rs 15-17 lakh per 10 seconds — to recover cost. “But considering current market conditions and the GDP, it is to be seen if the market is ready to accept such inflation,” Dias says.  However, Star India believes advertisers are ready to pay a premium for impact properties. When asked if advertisers will be willing to pay Rs 15 lakh per 10 seconds, Shankar tells ET, “If they want to advertise, they will... The market has clearly stepped up.” He adds that the market is getting polarised as “premium assets are getting very high inflation, while the discounted end of the market is getting even more discounted.”  Peter Hutton, chief executive, Eurosports, says, “I think it completely makes sense for Star to buy all rights, both broadcast and digital. I believe the gap between broadcast content and digital content will narrow over the next 5 years; it’ll just be about getting a stream to a screen.” The pan-European sports network is owned by Discovery Communications.      “It was a very smart bid,” adds Mogae’s Goyal. “There is no rocket science to it. Star will easily be able to make Rs 20,000 crore in five years.”  According to Indranil Das Blah, founding partner at sports marketing agency Kwan Entertainment & Marketing Solutions, the task ahead is challenging, but not impossible. “Star should be happy with the win. There is a big demand for IPL and it has grown continuously, year-on-year. It also gives Star complete ownership of cricket in India.”  Sony’s Loss is Star’s Gain While advertising revenue is a challenge, Star India may have to be aggressive with distribution platforms like cable and direct-to-home companies. Some distribution experts say SPN will see a major haircut in its distribution revenues because of loss of IPL, which will be Star’s gain. Experts believe that Star India, with its much stronger bouquet and other cricketing rights, will be in a position to exploit these rights.  As per industry estimates, SPN earns around Rs 2,000 crore as distribution revenues, of which a major chunk is because of IPL, though the company has never disclosed its sports-related distribution revenues. Also, Ten Sports, which SPN acquired from Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE), used to earn Rs 400 crore from distribution. “The challenge before Sony will be to retain Rs 2,400 crore in the absence of any driver property, unless it wins BCCI media rights next year. If not, almost Rs 800-1,000 crore will be shaved off Sony’s distribution revenues and most of it will go directly to Star,” says a senior executive of a multi system operator (MSO), who did not wish to be named.  Goyal adds, “Because of its monopoly, it can extract more from ground distribution. I am seeing an (additional) Rs 1,000 crore-a-year opportunity for Star, which will bring in an additional Rs 5,000 crore.”  Multiple cable and DTH executives ET spoke with agree Star will be looking at a sharp increase in subscription money, but how much they will get is a big question. “They have just won rights and I expect them to renegotiate deals before IPL next year. Problem is, they are already getting a huge share from our collection for their bouquet,” cautions another executive from a large MSO.  Last month, Jawahar Goel, CMD of India’s leading DTH company Dish TV, wrote to the Competition Commission of India, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the information & broadcasting ministry, voicing concerns over Star’s growing control over cricket. Many in the industry feel Goel’s fears are very valid today.  A former top boss of another MSO adds that Star stands to gain from a Trai tariff order on the rights of subscribers to pick channels, once it’s implemented.  “People will be able to select channels a la carte and most people want cricket more than music, movies and kids channels. With ICC, BCCI and now IPL, do you think they won’t subscribe for Star Sports? Star will definitely gain in those two months of IPL.”  Digital, The Dark Horse Star’s Shankar has already told ET in an interview that he is open to commercial arrangements with telecom operators on the digital front if it helps him monetise IPL. The fact that Facebook, Airtel and Reliance Jio bid over Rs 3,000 crore each for digital rights hints that they might be willing to partner Star as well.  Even from Hotstar’s point of view, IPL will drive customer acquisition, not just in India but globally. Star India could have multiple combinations such as providing a delayed feed as a freemium, adsupported model and a live feed under pay model. In developed markets, it may go for pay-per-view, where an IPL package may cost $50-100 per subscriber. “While TV advertising and distribution revenue will be based on how much the ecosystem evolves, the biggest opportunity lies in digital for Star India. It’s a new play,” says a senior sports marketing executive.  International Revenue The global opportunity is evident from the level of competition in markets such as North America, South Africa and the Middle East. Media experts believe Star may syndicate rights in some, or all, of these markets to earn handsome returns. “I would expect Star already to have deals in place with fellow Murdoch-owned Sky for the UK and Fox for Australia, so there is very little risk in their international number,” says a global sports marketing expert.  Goyal adds, “The rest of the world (ROW) is a big opportunity, both for TV and digital. There is a big Indian diaspora across markets like the US, UK, Middle East, Africa, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Cricket connects these Indians to their homeland. I believe Rs 500 crore per year from these markets is not a big deal.”  Star India will surely face a lot of resistance from advertisers, distributors and, in some cases, even consumers. Its task is certainly cut out, but not impossible."

"MUMBAI: Lighting products and consumer durables maker Bajaj ElectricalsNSE 1.40 % today said it is eyeing a turnover of Rs 5,000 crore this fiscal, while aiming to double it in the next four years.  ""There is negative sales in the first quarter (because of GST). We should be able to catch up a little bit in the second quarter, but July was very weak,"" Bajaj Electricals Chairman and Managing Director Shekhar Bajaj told PTI here.  ""For the year, we are still looking at 10 per cent growth in the consumer products and 20 per cent coming from EPC. From Rs 4,300 crore, which was last year, we should do about Rs 5,000 crore,"" he said.  Bajaj added that the company will grow at 15-20 per cent year on year and will take four years to become a Rs 10,000 crore company from Rs 5,000 crore.  However, he said the company will not look at the revenue share from engineering and projects (EPC) to be more than its consumer durable business.  ""Our business of EPC, we will not allow it to grow faster than our consumer product business. At least 50 per cent of our sales must come from consumer products because EPC business has its ups and downs and there is risk involved,"" he said.  The company is restructuring its consumer products business by adopting the distribution system from wholesale model and Bajaj said the company will complete the process by the fiscal year end.  ""We have covered 80,000 outlets already and by end of March, we should have covered 1,60,000 outlets, which will be 90 per cent of the market,"" he said.

Bajaj Electricals is also exploring opportunities in the internet of things (IoT) space and he said the first product in the cooler category would be out this year.  The company has already introduced luminaries with artificial intelligence."
"MUMBAI: Indian hotel industry revenue is expected to grow by 9-11 per cent in 2015-16 -- after a subdued growth rate of 5-8 per cent in the current fiscal, rating agency ICRA said in a report.  The growth is expected to strengthen in 2015-16 mainly on account of a modest increase in occupancy and small traction in rates, ICRA said.  The margins are expected to remain largely flat for the current fiscal 2014-15, while a moderate albeit sub-par expansion is expected in the next financial year.  While occupancies are showing signs of improvement, this appears to be driven by few pockets like Mumbai, where occupancies grew by 15 per cent year-to-date in December 2014 supported by traffic for large conferences and weddings.  Bengaluru has also exhibited some stabilisation with incremental supply being slowly absorbed. However, the newer properties launched during 2012-14 continue to struggle with weak revenue, the ICRA report said.  The National Capital Region (NCR) is exhibiting wide variation in performance across Delhi, Noida and Gurgaon, with Delhi showing marginal growth while trends in the Delhi Aerocity area and Gurgaon remained weak.  The country has around 29,000 premium rooms under development, which would be launched over the next six years.  It further added that the next supply bump will hit the market in 2016 across Bengaluru, Mumbai, Kolkata and Noida with over 6,500 rooms. Markets like Pune and Gurgaon will also see sizable room additions, it revealed.  Unless demand keeps pace, the widening supply-demand gap in these cities will impact rate integrity over the next two years, the report said."

"NEW DELHI: The Indian Railways posted revenue growth of more than 10% in the first quarter, aided by its dynamic fare system for premium trains.  Robust growth in the passenger and freight segments helped the railways boost combined revenue to Rs 43,000 crore in the three months ended June from Rs 38,833 crore in the same period last year.  Revenue in the passenger segment increased to almost Rs 14,000 crore from Rs 12,000 crore a year earlier. “This is the highest ever revenue railways has posted in the passenger segment.  Higher earnings have been driven due to the dynamic fare system for all premium trains. We have launched more premium trains such as Tejas, Humsafar and Uday, which will give a further boost to passenger earnings,” a top rail official said. “During this period, we booked almost 2,100 million passengers.”  Demand for travel in air-conditioned coaches has surged over the past three years, prompting the railways plans to start economy AC trains.  Freight loading also increased, backed by strong demand in transportation of iron ore, steel, food grains and other commodities. The railways transported almost 290 million tonnes of freight between April and June, making Rs 28,000 crore compared with Rs 25,000 crore a year earlier. The remaining revenue came from non-fare segments.  A revenue target of Rs 1.89 lakh crore has been set for the current financial year, of which Rs 1.18 lakh crore is expected from freight, almost Rs 52,000 crore from the passenger segment and the remainder from non-fare sectors.  “The freight loading increases in the period between December and March.

"BERLIN: Buoyed by India's plans to expand rail and metro network, Bombardier Transportation has exuded confidence over tripling its Indian business revenue to $ 1 billion in the next five years and plans to open an engineering centre in the country.  ""Yes, we are very ambitious with that and we are working actively on it (achieving $ 1 billion revenue from India in next five years from the present level of $ 300 million),"" Bombardier Transportation President Laurent Troger told PTI here.  Describing Bombardier as a ""major player"" in India for metro projects, he said, ""We are delivering very successfully for the metro in Delhi city. We are key player for the infrastructure...

He further added: ""Once we get to 1,000 screens, our revenue would be around Rs 3,500 crore to Rs 4,500 crore.""Rs 3,500 crore to Rs 4,500 crore.""  In FY 2015-16, PVR had a revenue of Rs 1,743.98 crore and this fiscal it would be around Rs 2,100 crore, Sood added.  With the increase in the number of screens, he said in the next three years ""people watching movies at our theatres will rise to 100 million from 75 million today"".  As the company grows, Sood said it would be a challenge to bring more variety to entertain millions of customers on a daily basis.  ""How do we complement more entertainment for the customers and how do we offer more variety under food and beverages (F&B)? Can we bring more merchandising and add more advertising revenue stream? That would be the two pillars of our strategy,"" he added.  As per its strategy, PVR would continue to grow in the existing Tier I and II cities and also go to Tier III and IV regions.  ""Today we are in 50 odd cities and our aim would be over the next five years to expand to 90 to 100 cities as we expand to 1,000 screen portfolio,"" Sood said.  PVR, which acquired DT Cinemas last year, would pursue both organic as well as inorganic growth opportunities as the sector is witnessing consolidation, the CFO said.  ""The bulk of growth would come from organic growth only as inorganic consolidation possibilities are very small, which are left right now. However, if there is something available on the way from inorganic prospective, we would look on it,"" Sood said.  Moreover, the company is also expecting that ratio of revenue from food and beverages (F&B) would increase from 26 per cent to 30 per cent 4-5 years.  ""Today a customers spends 40 per cent of its ticket price on F&B and our aim would be 5 years, it should go up to 50 per cent,"" he said."
"BANGALORE: WiproNSE 0.75 % Infrastructure Engineering is aiming for revenue of $1 billion (Rs 6,000 crore) by 2019, which will mean it will have to grow more than three-fold within five years to achieve its target.  At $300 million now, the Bangalore-based unit of Wipro Enterprises is looking to garner $250 million from its two youngest verticals, aerospace and defence, and water, CEO Pratik Kumar said.  ""Our stated aim is that in five years’ time, at least 25 per cent of our revenue at the company level should be coming out from new businesses, that is, water & aerospace and defence,"" he told ET.  Last year, Wipro demerged its consumer care, infrastructure engineering and medical devices businesses into a separate unlisted entity called Wipro Enterprises. Kumar also used to head human resources at the listed software firm Wipro, and was tasked last month with the job of fulltime CEO of Wipro Infrastructure Engineering.  ""First of all, any business requires full time attention. Because we have new lines of businesses that require a certain amount of bandwidth, if there is leadership entrusted, it is to help it make it grow,"" he said.  The company would forge two partnerships with original equipment manufacturers to produce precision engineering parts for flight control systems and auxiliary systems. Pratik declined to share details of the partnerships, saying any such news should become known in the next six months.  In May 2011, Wipro Infrastructure first signed an agreement with Spanish aerospace firm CESA, a subsidiary of Airbus parent EADS, to manufacture precision engineering parts for hydraulic actuators.  Win’s aggressive push into precision engineering space comes at a time when another Bangalore-based company, TitanNSE -0.73 %, too is aiming to record a ten-fold growth by 2019 in its smallest vertical, Precision Engineering.  The head of Titan’s Precision Engineering vertical R Vivekanandah, told ET last month that demand from aerospace, which currently is in nascent stage, could see revenue top Rs 1,000 crore from the current Rs 100 crore.  ""In another 20 years, global aircraft fleet demand is likely to double. You will have about 40,000 commercial aircraft from current 20,000 odd and that is a significant opportunity,"" Kumar said.  Wipro's aerospace and defence focus also comes at a time when the local defence manufacturing industry is eagerly awaiting billions of dollars in offset-related business. Indian policy mandates that foreign companies winning contracts worth over Rs 300 crore must spend least 30 per cent of the contract value on local procurement of components and services.  Wipro Infrastructure, which counts JCB and Caterpillar as its clients, has spent over Rs 500 crore in the last three years and believes its growth will not be ""capital guzzling,"" Kumar said.  The company has manufacturing bases in India, Sweden, Finland, Romania, Brazil, China and the US and employs around 1,700 people with the expectation that the workforce with increase to 4,000 in the next five years. It also has a water treatment business whose clients include Coca-Cola, GSK Pharma, RaymondNSE 0.87 %, Ambuja Cement and United Breweries.  It will have a workforce of nearly 4000 people in the next five years. At present, 50 per cent of the company’s $300 million revenues are from overseas markets, including Brazil, Europe and China. Kumar ruled out any plans of taking the company public, saying it is wellcapitalised and its continued push in the hydraulic cylinders business generates ample cash.  Wipro Infrastructure says it is the world’s largest independent manufacturer of hydraulic cylinders and pumps used in construction and mining equipment."

"BENGALURU: Internet retailers may have been the bane of the brick-and-mortar retail trade and a pain for the old order of things, but for one relic from the past, they are a proving to be a veritable godsend.  For India Post, a 240-year-old straggler long fighting for relevance in a digital economy, the explosive growth in this new-age business has offered it a fresh lease of life and given it the luxury of dreaming big.  These dreams have been bolstered by firms such as Flipkart and Amazon signing up for its services and with the theatre of activity for the fastgrowing ecommerce sector now moving to the country’s remote corners.  The Department of Posts is targeting a seemingly implausible 50-fold increase in ecommerce revenues. “With decline in document shipments, ecommerce is our department’s new focus,” a top official at the Department of Posts, told ET. “We are targetingRs 5,000 crore in revenue from this segment alone in the next 24 months.” It won’t be an easy task given that in the previous fiscal year to end-March 2014, it earnedRs 10,750 crore in overall turnover.  This year, it is on course to earnRs 100 crore as delivery revenues from ecommerce firms, giving the department’s claims a dark ring of incredulity as it is looking at a 50-fold jump in just two years. But officials point out that India Post had managed to expand ecommerce delivery revenues from Rs 20 crore toRs 100 crore in just a year, and given the explosive growth the sector is seeing, an exponential increase in revenues is not impossible. The department started cash on delivery pilots with Amazon in 2013. But the service picked up steam only in 2014, when it signed up players such as Flipkart, Snapdeal and Shopclues.  Karnataka and Haryana currently account for most ecommerce shipments followed by Delhi, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.India’s online retail industry is expected to soar to $23 billion (Rs 1.4 lakh crore) by 2018 from about $2 billion in 2013. The overall ecommerce sector, including online travel bookings, is projected at $43 billion by 2018, according to Nomura. To be sure, India Post will not have it easy, competing as it will be with several large logistics firms such as FedEx, DTDC, Blue DartNSE 0.12 % and DHL as well as a rash of startups such as Ecom Express and Delhivery that have jumped on to the bandwagon.  LEVERAGING ITS VAST NETWORK  India Post, founded as an arm of the East India Company, was a vital strategic institution for decades but its relevance declined dramatically as the rise of the Internet and use of emails for communication made its postcards and inland letters increasingly redundant.  But despite its mainstay business staring at oblivion, the department continued to have several advantages over its competitors, most notably its vast network of 1.5 lakh offices and an army of about 5.5 lakh employees across the country.  India Post has begun leveraging that strength now. It has begun training its postmen in ecommerce-specific requirements, such as accepting cash or card payments on delivery – crucial for online retailers in India – and handling same-day shipments. It also plans to open about 60 socalled fulfilment centres, where goods are stored and sorted before deliveries, across the country this year for its ecommerce business.  For instance in Bengaluru, India Post will invest Rs 1 crore to decentralise packaging and ecommerce parcel services by establishing warehouses across the city, according to MS Ramanujan, Chief Post Master General, Karnataka Circle. To compete with DHL, India Post plans to buy land near the airport to establish a warehousecum-parcel centre, he said.  In Bengaluru and Gurgaon, India Post is already handling about 13,000 and 20,000 shipments, respectively, every day. “We are currently stretched to our limits. Opening ecommerce specific warehouses will lessen the load on post offices,” said the official of the Department of Post, quoted earlier.  LESSONS FROM THE WEST  India Post can take heart from the experience of other countries where explosive growth of ecommerce has changed fortunes of their state-run postal departments.  In the West, government postal services have gained the most from the ecommerce sector.  “The US Post is expected to earn half of its revenues from ecommerce package deliveries by 2020. Deutsche Post in Germany and Australia Post have also done well,” said Arvind Singhal, head of retail advisory firm Technopak.  Its customers, many of whom are now looking to spread their wings in the hinterland to tap the market potential in India’s small towns and villages, have good things to say.  “Given the vastness of our country, India Post plays a key role in offering a seamless experience for our customers who are located in the most remote parts of India,” said Neeraj Aggarwal, senior director, supply chain, at Flipkart, which has been working with India Post since last year in addition to its own logistics firm Ekart.  India’s ecommerce logistics market is expected to gross overRs 7,200 crore ($1.2 billion) this year.  According to consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, ecommerce firms will need about 15 million sq ft of warehouse space by 2017, up from about 1.7 million sq ft available now. “Getting manpower for last-mile delivery and high expectations of same-day delivery due to technology integration are major challenges for us,” said an official at a large ecommerce logistics player, declining to be identified. Shrinking air cargo space and rising costs have also put pressure on private companies to increase shipment rates. “I don’t see shipment costs going down in 2015,” said Mohit Tandon, cofounder at Gurgaon-based logistics startup Delhivery. India Post claims an advantage here, too."
"MUMBAI: Riding high on initiatives taken by the government to promote solar energy, power solutions provider Jakson Group is eyeing nearly Rs 1,000 crore revenue from this segment alone in FY17.  ""The government has set a target of 100 GW of solar capacity by 2022. This gives a huge opportunity for players like us who provide end-to-end solutions for setting up the capacities, manufacturing solar panels and other products,"" MD of Jackson Group Sameer Gupta told PTI here.  The company is eyeing Rs 2,500 crore revenue in financial year 2016-17, out of which it expects the solar business, which includes solar power generation, manufacturing of panels, products and rooftop EPC projects, to contribute around Rs 1,000 crore, he said.  Jakson Group manufactures diesel and gas gensets, other solar products like solar panels, street lights, purifiers, gensets and also undertakes EPC electrical contracting works.  The company made its foray into solar power generation with the commissioning of 30 MW project.  It hopes to close this fiscal with revenues of around Rs 1500 crore, out of which its core business of gensets is expected to contribute Rs 1,000 crore, Rs 300 crore from solar EPC contracts, sale of panels and other solar products, Rs 50 crore from solar IPP (30 MW) and Rs 150 crore from electrical EPC contracts.  ""Currently, we have 30 MW solar plant operational and another 30 MW will be operational by June-July this year. This gives us a clear visibility of Rs 100 crore revenue from IPP business in FY17. We are confident of achieving more than Rs 1,000 crore revenue from solar business in FY17,"" Gupta said.  The firm expects many EPC contracts in the solar space from both the public and private sectors. It also plans to increase its solar panels manufacturing capacity from 75 MW currently to 250 MW over the next 2 years, he added.  ""We are looking at expanding this capacity to not only serve the domestic market but also for exports. Currently, we have a manufacturing facility in Greater Noida of 75 MW. Now we are looking at locations near ports to facilitate exports in markets like the Middle East and Africa,"" he said.  The company is also looking at joint ventures especially for technology transfer for setting up panel manufacturing plants to expand the capacity to 250 MW.  It is considering the port areas in states like Gujarat and Telangana and plans to invest Rs 300 crore for setting up such facilities."
"NEW DELHI: The revenue from the sale of 3G spectrum today crossed the Rs 51,000-crore mark as the bid price for a national licence rose to Rs 12,851 crore on Day 25 of the auction.    At the current all-India bid price, the government is assured of at least Rs 51,833 crore over an estimated revenue of Rs 35,000 crore from sale of spectrum for 3G and broadband wireless access (BWA) services.    Today's auction saw the highest-ever single day jump in revenue so far at Rs 3,156 crore.    On the basis of yesterday's price, the government's assured revenue stood at Rs 48,677 crore. The all-India 3G licence reserve price is Rs 3,500 crore.    Mumbai continued to lead the pack at Rs 2,316 crore, followed by Delhi circle at Rs 2,209 crore, while Karnataka came in third at Rs 1,374.51 crore today.    At the end of 143 rounds of auction, there was excess demand in all the circles, indicating the bid is set to rise further.    Gujarat, which had pipped Delhi as the most valued circle in the earlier rounds, has been losing its attraction lately, having slipped to the seventh position today in terms of bid value at Rs 1,023.86 crore.    As per the latest data on the department of telecom's website, Maharashtra, which saw negative demand, had the fourth highest bid price of Rs 1,127.47 crore, followed by Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh at Rs 1,171.75 crore and Rs 1,070.84 crore at the end of the 25th day.    Telecom minister Andimuthu Raja had recently stated that the government may garner Rs 50,000-55,000 crore by selling 3G airwaves and BWA spectrum.    Uttar Pradesh (West), Kolkata and Uttar Pradesh (East) saw bid prices rising to Rs 374 crore, Rs 351.79 crore and Rs 276.05 crore, respectively.    Category C circles like Haryana, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh, Northeast and J&K continue to see negative demand.    In all, nine mobile operators are up against each other for spectrum for 3G services, which allows subscribers to download hi-speed data and stream videos on mobile phones. The radio waves are being auctioned across 22 circles."
"NEW DELHI: Reliance CommunicationsNSE -3.57 % expects its enterprise business revenue to grow 24% this financial year with a 28% growth at the operating profit level, spurred by new product launches and expected growth from major target segments like banking, financial services and information technology and related services.  “We hope to get a third of the incremental market share this fiscal year,” Deepak Khanna, chief executive officer of the company’s domestic enterprise business, told ET.  The business generates around 12% of Reliance Communications overall annual revenue, which was at Rs22,321.3 crore in the last fiscal year ended March 31, which comes to over Rs 2600 crore. The company is India's fourth largest mobile phone operator.  In his first media interview since joining the company early September 2013, Khanna said the company has recently launched three products for enterprises, including storage services on cloud – Arch Store; video surveillance services on cloud; wireless internet for enterprises, using the CDMA and 3G base stations; and insta-call, which allows automated reception and responses to customer queries.  “The main segments are BFSI, IT & ITES, government business, and small and medium sized businesses”, said Khanna, adding that data centre and hosted services are also important.  The domestic enterprise vertical is essentially RCOM's corporate customer business in India and is considered a high margin operation since companies shell out higher sums for managed services compared with retail customers. Some put operating margins in the business at as high as 50%, compared with the 34.6% annual operating margins that the company ended last fiscal year with.  Apart from handling voice and data connectivity requirements of key corporates and banks, RCOM also manages their data centre service needs. Some of RCOM's biggest enterprise business customers are HDFC BankNSE 0.34 %, Hindustan UnileverNSE 0.66 %, WiproNSE 0.75 %, InfosysNSE 0.68 %, ICICI BankNSE 1.17 %, Axis BankNSE 1.60 %, Citibank, Asian PaintsNSE 1.09 % and the Bombay Stock Exchange.  He expects the enterprise segment revenue to double in the next three years, given the potential in the $4 billion market.  RCOM's increased focus on the enterprise business comes at a time when mobile phone companies, including the company itself, have seen improved business fundamentals amid higher call charges and data revenues. In the fourth quarter ended March, the company’s operational parameters, such as average revenue per user, improved sequentially as easing competition allowed it to raise telephone call prices."
"MUMBAI: The Indian unit of the world's largest retailer, Walmart Stores, posted a 7% rise in revenue and narrowed losses in consumer goods market that saw decade low sales growth.  Walmart India posted sales of Rs 3,996.8 crore for fifteen months ended March 2016 compared to Rs 2,991 crore during twelve months ended December 2014. While sales grew 34%, the company grew 7% on annualised basis. Losses declined from Rs 232.2 crore to Rs 140.4 crore in the same period.  The company opened one store after a gap of more than two years to take its store count to 21. The new store opened in Agra was also its first after becoming a fully-owned subsidiary of Walmart Stores Inc.  ""We are excited with this continuous progress and our contribution to the Indian economy through job creation, supporting 'Make in India' through local sourcing, supporting women entrepreneurs, small and medium enterprises, start-up entrepreneurs and farmers,"" said Krish Iyer, CEO of Walmart India, where more than 95% of goods sold are locally sourced.  ""Through our growing footprint in the country, we will continue to grow our business profitably while contributing to the growth & prosperity of the nation.""  About three years ago, Walmart agreed to buy Bharti's 50% in their wholesale business that operated Best Price Modern Wholesale stores and terminated franchise and supply agreements related to almost 200 EasyDay retail stores. With the joint venture getting dissolved, Walmart now sells goods only to traders, institutions and kiranas. The termination of supply agreement with EasyDay stores affected overall sales a year ago, when its revenue dipped 32%.  Most wholesale operators are bullish on expansion - rival Metro AG, which had not been able to capitalise on its first-mover advantage, wants to double wholesale stores in the country to 50 by 2020. While latest performance isn't available, Metro Cash & Carry India incurred a loss of Rs 142 crore on a turnover of Rs 3,439.9 crore for 2013-14.  Walmart too announced it would add 50 stores in the next 4-5 years in India after store expansion was put on hold until August 2015 amid an ongoing internal probe to check if its local unit had violated the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  While organised wholesalers that sell merchandise to local kirana stores, hotels and catering firms operate in 12 states; Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra contribute half the sales. Soft drinks (12%) dominate the channel in terms of value within the CPG space, followed by toilet soaps (9%) and washing powder (8%), according to a Nielsen report last year.  With at least four players, Walmart, Metro, Bookers and Reliance —operating 92 cash and carry stores, nearly 2.6% of traditional trade in all consumer product goods (CPG) moves through organised wholesale. The Rs 6,800 crore market has been growing at 13%, faster than modern trade, albeit on a lower base.  In 2015-16, sales growth of consumer goods slowed the most in about a decade, suggesting that Indians cut spending — especially on discretionary products — due to high inflation and a sluggish economy."
"Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), the Railway Ministry’s e-ticketing arm, will list its shares on stock exchanges, potentially making for the largest public offering by a domestic ecommerce company in recent years.  “Railway related state-run companies like IRCON and IRCTC to be listed on stock exchanges to increase accountability,” Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said presenting the Union Budget for 2017-18.  But he also announced that the service charge on booking tickets through IRCTC would be abolished, which could put the company’s business model in question. Service charges account for more than one-third of IRCTC’s revenue.  The government-owned website, which gets a commission on each ticket sold, posted a 32% increase in revenue to Rs 1,506 crore in fiscal 2016, according to its annual report.  Revenue earned through service charge was the fastest-growing segment, doubling from Rs 256.34 crore to Rs 551.49 crore in fiscal 2016.  IRCTC charges Rs 40 on every ticket booked in air-conditioned classes. For sleeper class, a service charge of Rs 20 is levied.  “Leaving behind several high profile ecommerce sites worldwide, e-ticketing accounted for 58.5% of reserved tickets in India booked online during 2015-16, which has now risen to around 60%. On an average, more than 5.45 lakh tickets were sold daily through IRCTC’s website during 2015-16,"" the company said in its annual report.  IRCTC also earns revenue through sales of Rail Neer bottled water, onboard catering and licence fees from outsourced catering vendors.  The company sold train tickets worth Rs 24,022 crore online in the year ended March 2016, although growth halved to 17% from a year earlier as its customer base stagnated.  Net profit grew 44% to Rs 189 crore."
"NEW DELHI: Consumer appliances and electronic goods maker Haier India is looking to treble its revenue to Rs 6,500 crore by 2020 on the back on increased manufacturing and increased penetration of consumer goods in the country.  ""By 2020, we are looking at being a USD 1 billion company... our turnover will be close to Rs 6,500 crore. There is no reason why we should not go close to this number that we are targeting. We will also have our higher production capacity in place,"" Haier India president Eric Braganza told PTI.  He further said: ""Penetration levels (of consumer goods) in India are not very high, we estimate that our industry and market will keep growing, by 2020 the market should be at least 30 to 40 per cent bigger as compared to what it is today.""  Haier India, which is expecting to close the year with over Rs 2,000 crore revenue, has invested Rs 490 crore to expand capacity at its existing manufacturing facility at Ranjangaon near Pune.  ""We have invested Rs 490 crore at our plant at Ranjangaon Pune to double capacity of refrigerator production and make new products too. We had to increase the production capacity due to the growth in the sales, therefore we had to build up additional manufacturing facility in India,"" he said.  Earlier the company was only making refrigerators at the plant. Now it will also make washing machines, ACs, TV panels and water heaters.  Haier India, a 100 per cent subsidiary of China's Haier Group, began operations in 2004 and started manufacturing in India by acquiring a 40-acre plant at Ranjangoan in 2007."

"NEW DELHI: Mobile phone companies BhartiAirtelNSE -1.27 % and Idea CellularNSE -1.23 % have increased their market share in terms of revenue in the three months to December, a sign that their strategy of focusing on data and cutting discounts has begun to pay off.  In contrast, RCOM and Aircel, which had been gaining market share since the first quarter, have lost pace, according to data provided by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai). Telenor's Indian unit, Uninor, also lost market share (revenue) as it closed operations in a few circles.  ""Incumbents' strategy of improving revenue market share seems to be paying off as they focus on revenue from data and weeding out subscribers that do not bring revenue,"" said an analyst from a Mumbai-based consulting firm. ""Operators have started to focus on profitability, which can be clearly seen in case of new operators who have shut operations in some circles to make business viable.""  Telecom operators have also increased tariffs and cut down on freebies and discounts to increase profitability.  Bharti, the country's top mobile phone operator, recorded its largest increase in revenue share since the beginning of this financial year, accounting for 30.4% share of the industry's sales for the December quarter, up from 29.9% in the previous quarter.  The company did not respond to ET's query on its performance.  ""Domestic volume growth picked up in Q3 - traditionally a strong quarter for telcos - which drove the revenue increase for Bharti,"" Bhavesh Gandhi, analyst with India Infoline Research, said in a note to clients. ""After an adjusted 28 basis points quarter-on-quarter drop in revenue market share in Q2, Bharti regained the lost ground with a gain of 50 basis points to 30.4% in Q3.""  Brokerage houses and analysts said Bharti's revenue market share had to be adjusted for the one-time gain in revenues in the second quarter from an outstanding dispute in TDSAT related to inter-connect charges, due to which the revenues were slightly inflated. Therefore, the company's actual revenue market share in the September quarter had declined by 28 basis points from 30.1% in the quarter ended June, and its share in the December quarter improved on an organic basis.                       Following telecom tribunal TDSAT's favorable order, Bhartirecognised revenues of Rs 586 crore in the September quarter. Bharti's regional markets showed massive improvement as revenue share in Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, UP East and Bihar rose by more than 1.5% on average. While Karnataka grew by 0.7%, Andhra Pradesh saw a loss of 1.1% revenue share in the third quarter, IIFL Research said.  Idea Cellular, too, gained more than 20 basis points in three months to December, strengthening its revenue market share to 14.8% after two quarters of slide. The company regained lost ground in Maharashtra, where it is the market leader, with a 65 basis points rise in revenue share while in Kerala and Madhya Pradesh its share grew by 97 and 96 basis points, respectively.  The company declined to comment on its performance.  For Vodafone, the country's second-largest mobile phone company by subscribers, revenue market share remained stable for the third straight quarter at 22.5%.  A company spokesperson, however, said its share had grown to 21.3% on the back of growth in voice from new circles of Assam, the Northeast, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, J&K, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, which were acquired in 2008-09, besides rise in overall data revenues.  ""More than 33.1 million mobile internet users contribute roughly 6.2% of the total revenues as of Q3. The number of internet users has doubled over the last two to three years, while the overall quality of customers has improved, which is evident in our VLR numbers,"" he said.  The revenue market share of Anil Ambani-promoted RCOM, the third largest operator, dipped to 7.9% in the December quarter, down from 8.1% in the second quarter when the growth had been more than 40 basis points.  The dual-technology telco, whose share has remained above 7% in the last few quarters, has seen headline tariffs rise by 25%. The company has also purged more than 35 million inactive subscribers to improve its financial health.  A spokesperson for RCOM said, ""Over the last few quarters, RCOM has been making concerted efforts to improve market share, quality of customer acquisition, and enhance performance. These efforts have triggered a strong growth phase, with our revenue market share increasing by almost a 100 basis points - from 7.1% in the quarter ended June 2012 to about 8% in two successive quarters ending September and December 2012.""  While the revenue market share of Tata TeleservicesNSE 1.64 %, another dual-technology player, remained flat at 8.5%, Aircel's stood at 5.2% on a drop of about 10 basis points.  Aircel told ET that overall share slipped despite a gain of more than 200 basis points in all the key market and leadership circles. ""At a holistic level, because of Aircel's strategy of taking its business on-line in loss-making circles, the gain in its key markets stands suppressed and at an overall level its share has declined marginally,"" a company spokesperson said.  Uninor's revenue share took a hit as it shut down operations in West Bengal, Kolkata and Mumbai and let go of nearly 2 million subscribers in the process.  Analysts said the company will remain under pressure over the next few quarters as it begins to focus on six circles where it won spectrum in the November auctions.  ""We have been compelled to close down operations in some large circles, which obviously affects customer and subscriber market share when seen pan India,"" a company spokesperson said. However, he added that the real measure is the performance in the six circles ""where revenues have increased by Rs 48 crore while the industry has de-grown by Rs 16 crore""."
"KOLKATA: The telecom arm of Indian Railways, RailTel Corporation, is looking to double its turnover to Rs 1,000 crore in two years as the company expands into retail broadband and telepresence services.

On the services, RailTel director A Seshagiri Rao said: ""We are targeting Rs 50 crore fees in the first year itself from Telepresence services.""  Bahuguna said enterprise business, projects and retail broadband would be the future growth drivers for the company.  On company's main revenue contributers Bahuguna said, about 25 per cent of its revenue comes from enterprise connectivity fees from telecom companies, another 25 per cent from government including educational institutes, 15 per cent from cable multi-system operators (MSOs).  Indian railways share, however, is just 10 per cent, while project execution business is also gaining momentum, he said.  Over the years, as telecom companies are building their own optical fibre cable (OFC) network, the state enterprise is trying to foray into new avenues such retail broadband and telepresence services.  Railtel, which has about 45,000 km of OFC network across the country, will scale it up to 50,000 km by this fiscal.

Replying to a query, Mani said that for the present growth expectations, the company would need additional working capital after two to three years.  He, however, said currently there are no plans to dilute any equity for capital infusion. The company, which has 23 manufacturing facilities across the country, is a closely-held entity by nine families.  On an average the Kerala-based footwear maker produces about 4.5 lakh pairs a day."
"NEW DELHI: Even in the absence of a spectrum auction in the current fiscal, the Department of Telecom (DoT) is all set to earn a revenue of over Rs 49,000 crore, exceeding the budgeted target by about Rs 6,000 crore.  The government had pegged revenue from communication services for the current fiscal at Rs 42,865 crore, including upfront realisation from spectrum sale and licence fee.  ""The revenue projection for the current fiscal is over Rs 49,000 crore, of which Rs 37,000 crore have already been received till December,"" Telecom Secretary Rakesh Garg told PTI.  Elaborating, Garg said DoT got Rs 22,332.42 crore as upfront fee from spectrum auction in March, Rs 6,701.92 crore licence fee, Rs 5,754.53 crore spectrum charges and about Rs 2,246.09 crore through other receipts till December.  That apart, DoT has received Rs 5,384 crore from Reliance CommunicationsNSE -3.57 % as spectrum liberalisation fee for 16 circles whereas Vodafone has paid Rs 2,450 crore for merger of its various subsidiaries.  Garg said the Department will get spectrum charges and licence fee for the remaining three months of the current fiscal, and liberalisation fee for the remaining four circles of Reliance Communications.  DoT, Garg said, has asked Trai to give its view on the four circles where market-determined price is not available and once that is clear, the proceeds from Reliance Communications will total about Rs 6,000 crore.  Reliance Communications had applied to liberalise its 800 MHz spectrum in 20 circles.  The government, according to Garg, is likely to conduct next round of spectrum auction around May-June this year.  Sector regulator Trai is likely to give recommendations about the reserve price by the end of this month.  Garg said that after Trai's views, it takes about 4-5 months for the whole process to shape up as DoT may require some clarifications. The Telecom Commission also needs to approve the reserve price before the Cabinet gives its final approval.  In the March auction, the government had got about Rs 1.10 lakh crore from sale of spectrum in four bands -- 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2100 MHz. The government had put about 470.75 MHz of spectrum for auction of which around 11 per cent remained unsold."
"NEW DELHI: Higher capacity deployment and introduction of new flights helped Air India Express report an 18 per cent increase in operating revenue to Rs 1,897 crore in the April-September period of the current fiscal.  The airline's operating revenue in the first of the 2014-15 stood at Rs 1609 crore,  ""According to the unaudited earnings, which the board approved at its meeting yesterday, our operating revenue surged 18 per cent to Rs 1,897 crore during the first half of the current financial year,"" Air India Express Chief Executive Officer K Shyamsundar told PTI.  The airline during the period increased capacity by 21 per cent in addition to a higher utilisation of the fleet, he said, adding, ""all this resulted in posting a profit of Rs 415 crore in the first six months of the current fiscal.""  The Kochi-based low-cost airline turned profitable in the last fiscal, posting a profit of Rs 362 crore on the back of lower fuel prices and improved revenues over the past year on the back of flying more people per flight.  Air India Express is the international budget arm of the national carrier Air India Express. At present, it flies to 15 international destinations across Gulf and South-east Asia from 14 domestic airports with a fleet of 23 Boeing 737 planes.  The airline carried 1.64 million passengers during the period while the seat factor stood at 79 per cent, he said.  Load or seat factor is a measure of how much of an airline's passenger carrying capacity is used or average percentage of seats filled in an aircraft.  Air India Express added four more leased Boeing B737-800 planes in its fleet during the April-September period of this fiscal, taking the total number of planes with the airline to 21, he said.  ""The first half of the fiscal year also witnessed start of new operations to Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and Damam from New Delhi, Chandigarh, Tiruchirappalli and Kochi,"" Shyamsundar said.  With the induction of two more B 737-800 NG aircraft in the 3rd quarter, the airline's fleet size now stands at 23.

AIE has also decided to offer ticket booking facility through net banking, in addition to the existing credit/debit card- based online payment mode in the wake of Government's increase thrust on digital payments, he said."
"MUMBAI: Hotels in India reported over 5% year on year growth in occupancy in the quarter ended March, helped by a rise in corporate demand and domestic travel, a new report has said.  Hotels reported 67.6% occupancy in the first quarter of 2016, 5.1% growth over the year-ago period, while their revenue per available room (RevPAR) rose 6.7% to Rs 4,190.90 during the same period, according to a report by US data analytics firm STR that tracks the hotel industry across the world.  “India experienced a strong performance in the first quarter of 2016, particularly in March. Occupancy has really picked up this year for most cities in India, which has helped boost RevPAR levels,” said an STR analyst.  Occupancy was the main driver of performance for the quarter linked to slowing supply growth in the country's major cities, it said.  Reduced supply of new rooms in certain markets such as Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Ahmedabad and Jaipur coupled with rising demand allowed hotels to increase rates.  According to the STR analyst, Jaipur recorded significantly higher occupancy this March than in previous years. During the first three months, demand for hotel rooms in India grew by 8.9% and the supply increased 3.6%.  Now global hotel chains are bullish on the Indian market which is witnessing faster growth than many major markets around the world.  During an investors call this week, Patrick J Grismer, chief financial officer at Hyatt Hotels, said that while the group’s hotels saw double-digit reduction in RevPAR in France and Middle East on account of reduction in travel following the terrorist attacks in Paris last November and the ongoing geopolitical instability, respectively, India remained a bright spot with Rev-PAR growth in the high single-digit percentage, driven by increased transient demand across the country.  Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson in an investors' call early this week had said, “In India the economy is strengthening and first quarter RevPar was at 14%.”"
"MUMBAI: The corporate healthcare sector is expected to clock a stable revenue growth of about 15 per cent this fiscal on account of rise in health insurance coverage and completion of new facilities, a report said.  ""We expect stable outlook on the corporate healthcare sector for FY 2017-18, based on the expectation of continued stable revenue growth,"" India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) said in its report.  The sector will continue to report stable revenue growth rate of around 15 per cent during the fiscal, driven by the completion of new facilities and the increase in health insurance coverage, it said.  The sector's revenue growth in the first half of 2016-17 was in line with Ind-Ra's earlier estimates of around 15 per cent for that fiscal. Though the revenue in the third quarter of the fiscal impacted by about 10 per cent on Q-o-Q due to demonetisation, it is likely to revert to earlier growth rates in the fourth quarter, the report said.  Health insurance coverage increased at a CAGR of 28.9 per cent over 2013-14 to 2015-16, driven by government- sponsored schemes. This bodes well for the sector as it increases the addressable market size and would aid in an increased utilisation of facilities.  However, the tilt towards the government schemes is a concern due to lower profitability on the procedures covered by such schemes and the longer collection periods involved.  The report said the large corporate hospital chains would benefit in attracting patients to their old and new facilities by virtue of their established brands and their ability to attract reputed doctors.  They would also be better placed to absorb initial negative cash flows in the new facilities due to the stable cash flows from their established operations, it said.  The sector has seen significant interest from private equity or strategic foreign investors over the last three years, looking at leveraging the established brands of regional or sub-regional players to create strong national or regional chains to extend reach to customers in tier-2 and tier-3 centres and derive benefits of scale.  While investments in greenfield and brownfield expansion continue, companies are increasingly looking at acquisitions as means to enter new cities. It provides them with an existing doctor and patient base and ready infrastructure, using which they can build their operations, the report said.  Ind-Ra said that significant portion of the capex is likely to be in the private sector. Among the leading healthcare chains, Apollo Hospitals Enterprises is looking at adding 1,045 beds by 2018-19, Narayana Hrudayalaya by 647 beds by 2019-20, Manipal Health Enterprises by 1,000 beds by 2018- 19 and Quality Care India by 620 beds by 2019-20, it said.  Acquisitions are sometimes the only viable option given the scarcity of land within city centres and the long-time frame involved in setting up a greenfield hospital.  Profit margins will continue to be impacted by the sector's expansion plans owing to the long break-even periods for new facilities, it said."
"KOLKATA: Diversified group ITC has set a target of garnering a revenue of Rs 1 lakh crore by 2030 from its FMCG business, as it looks to increase presence in the segment, company's chairman Y C Deveshwar said today.  At present, revenue from FMCG business stands at around Rs 9,000 crore.  ""We will enter anything and everything that can be classified as FMCG over a period of time,"" Deveshwar told shareholders at the company's AGM here.  Saying that ITC was targetting to garner a business volume of Rs 1 lakh crore from FMCG business alone by 2030, Deveshwar said the company was investing heavily in brands to create consumer franchise in number of ways.  ""The company has made relentless efforts in building world class brands, which had garnered an annual consumer spend of Rs 11,000 crore,"" he said.  Deveshwar said ITC was not on the bottomline growth path but on the topline instead. ""This is why the company is creating the brands of tomorrow,"" he said.  On the cigarettes business, he said the regulatory environment was not entirely rational.  ""I wonder some NGOs are acting as agents of overseas cigarette companies helping smuggling of cigarettes into the country. Smuggling of cigarettes are rising while the legal cigarette industry is losing volumes which is causing the Indian farmers to lose income"", he said.  ""We are continuously engaging with governments both at the central and state levels and hopefully there will be some rationality next year,"" he said.  Stating that ITC would be one of the most profitable FMCG companies in future, Deveshwar said the company was trying to build market position to make it ready for the future.  ""Profits are not the only indicator of success. For instance e-commerce companies are losing cash as they are in the process of building market position. This is what ITC is doing by investing in brands,"" he said.  Regarding investments, he said ITC was investing Rs 3,500 crore in West Bengal in two factories, infotech centre and one hotel.  The company is also investing Rs 6,000 crore at the Telengana paper mill to double capacity.  ITC was envisaging an outlay of Rs 25,000 crore across 65 projects in the country.  Yesterday, ITC LtdNSE 3.15 % has posted a subdued 3.61 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 2,265.44 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, due to pressure on cigarette sales and sluggish demand for other FMCG products.  Net sales, declined 7.18 per cent to Rs 8,505.53 crore for the quarter as against Rs 9,164.42 crore during June quarter of the previous fiscal, ITC said."
"MUMBAI: Drug maker Venus RemediesNSE -0.43 % expects Rs 1,000 crore revenue by FY'17 from the present Rs 460 crore on the back of higher exports.

The company has already launched this product in India and plans to launch it in Japan by end of 2015.  ""We expect Elores to generate a revenue of around USD 100 million by 2018,"" he added.  The company also hopes to increase its overall exports share to 50 per cent from the present 31 per cent in US, Canada, Japan, Europe and South Korean markets.  ""We are not exporting to US market since we don't have USFDA approved facility. However, we are looking at alliances with pharma majors to market our R&D products in developed markets including US,"" Aggarwal said.  Aggarwal said that the company spent 18-20 per cent towards R&D till FY'12 and 15 per cent in FY'13. The company hopes to spend nearly 10 per cent on R&D going forward."
"MUMBAI | NEW DELHI: The Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corp (IRCTC) sold train tickets worth Rs 24,022 crore ($3.5 billion) online in the year ended March 2016, although growth halved to 17% from a year earlier as its customer base stagnated.The government-owned portal, which gets a commission on each ticket sold, posted a 32% increase in revenue to Rs 1,506 crore, according to a filing with the Registrar of Companies. Its revenue come from service charge on tickets, sales of Rail Neer packaged water, onboard catering services and licence fees from outsourced catering vendors. Just as with online marketplaces, the corporation’s sales don’t include actual goods sold and consist only of commission from sellers and revenue from advertisements on its ecommerce site. IRCTC’s net profit grew 44% to Rs 189 crore. “The base of people booking tickets hasn’t increased as much as it did last year as the market has stagnated a little,” said IRCTC Chairman AK Manocha. “Last year, we added huge capacity to absorb the pent-up demand. With better penetration of internet in rural market, we will have more users. It may not grow at 30% as it did in the last few years, but it would be strong growth anyway.”   Manocha said IRCTC’s revenue could double to Rs 3,000 crore by 2019. The company’s contribution to the railways in the form of haulage charges, concession and licence fees, user charges and dividend, jumped more than sevenfold to Rs 396.46 crore. India’s internet market size will grow to $159 billion by 2020 from $16 billion now to emerge as the fastest-growing ecommerce market globally, a Morgan Stanley report estimates.IRCTC says it is the largest ecommerce website in Asia-Pacific, with 15-18 million transactions a month and about 12 million visitors each month. IRCTC has tied up with non-rival companies seeking to tap the rail portal’s 42.5 million users, with 15,000 being added every day on average.IRCTC received Rs 18 crore from a co-branding initiative with Amazon, while banner advertisements on its website through Google brought in Rs 20 crore.The company is launching a new app that will incorporate cab and hotel booking and food delivery services, an initiative that may yield Rs 100 crore. The subsidiary of the Indian Railways is looking to monetise segments such as packaged water and catering. The Rail Neer business generated Rs 118.48 crore, while the catering department made Rs 255.5 crore for IRCTC. “The demand at railway stations is over 100 crore bottles of one-litre packs but we are able to supply only 20 crore bottles. With more plants in the pipeline, we can sell the brand outside stations as well. Also, from 40-50 trains we plan to cover 1,000 trains and set up 75 base kitchens in terms of catering to target Rs 1,000 crore revenue only just on-board catering services,” Manocha said."
"NEW DELHI: The Railways had to grapple with shortfall in revenue targets and ""unbearable burden"" of Pay Commission recommendations in 2015 and hopes to address the twin issues next year.  Though earnings were up by 6.67 per cent up to December 10 as compared to last year, there was a decline in meeting the target. Railways' earnings till December 10 were Rs 1,11,834.32 crore as against the target of Rs 1,22,639.16 crore, a decline of 8.8 per cent.  ""In 2015, one of the challenges we have been facing is not getting enough cargo. So revenues are down. Because steel, cement, iron ore demand is very bad. Import and export are down. These are sources for cargo. So targets are falling short,"" Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu told PTI.  He said this when asked about his regrets in 2015 on things he could not do or could have done better.  He also said Seventh Pay Commission recommendations are equally a major challenge as Railways has to shell out additional Rs 32,000 crore annually.  ""Secondly, Pay Commission recommendation is another big challenge. The Rs 32,000 crore additional burden for Pay Commission on Railways is unbearable. These are major challenges,"" he said and added ""these were two challenges of 2015 I hope we will be able to address it in 2016. On Pay Commission, we will have to talk to the Finance Ministry.""  Asked whether the recent slum demolition incident involving death of a child at Shakurbasti in Delhi is a setback as it would not be easy to evacuate encroachers from railway land, Prabhu said, ""Public property is used for public good. So we have to find out ways. There has to be a public debate. We do not want to construct bungalows there.""  However, he emphasised on adopting human approach in dealing with removal of encroachers.  ""We have to find out best possible ways and at the same time I have instructed all my officers to do it in a humane way. I was not aware when demolitions took place, otherwise I would have told them not to do it at this particular time. But we will handle it in a humane way.""  Asked why he did not raise fares despite adverse financial condition, Prabhu quoted Abraham Lincoln saying, ""We have tried to do everything in the interest of Railways. So what we have done is for the Railways, by the Railways and of the Railways.""  However, he said there were many good things that happened in Railways in 2015.  ""In 2015, we have done many things. First of all, getting huge resources for Railway which was always a problem. Getting finances for Railways is a great achievement,"" he said.  Known for his reform-oriented approach, Prabhu described the decision to delegate powers to senior railway officials including tenders as ""path-breaking"" and an attempt to bring transparency in Railways.  ""I have started restructuring by delegating powers to general managers and divisional railway managers which is path-breaking in Railways. We brought a complete transparency into the Railways. Not a single tender has come to me since I became minister. This is a major reform in Railways,"" he claimed.  Focusing on transparency, he said steps are being taken for bringing all tenders on e-tendering mode. ""Now we are bringing all tenders under e-tendering platform. We have started postings, appointments, transfer also a in a transparent way.  ""We have started a process of online examination for recruitment which will eliminate corruption in a significant way.""  Referring to ""Make-in-India"" campaign in Railways, he said, ""We have started the campaign in a major way by launching Rs 40,000 crore locomotive projects in Madhepura and Marhora in Bihar.  ""This is a big 'Make-in-India' effort as it will bring jobs that to in Bihar. This will also bring new technology to India.""  He said many ancillary units will be benefiting from the projects as there will be suppliers for the factories.  ""It will bring small and medium level economy system in India. Since these manufacturers are supplying to a world's top company they will supply to other countries in due course,"" he said.  On the decision on the multi-crore Train Set project, he said, ""Whether locomotive factories or train set, I took the decisions for Railways' interest. Whatever was in Railways interest, I tried to do that.""  Highlighting the comprehensive agreement with Japan on rail sector, Prabhu said, ""Japanese collaboration is going to upgrade our existing system including safety, research in a significant way. Agreement on bullet train is also there.""  Referring to the Rail Budget 2015-16, he said majority of announcements made have been implemented.  ""We have fulfilled 110 announcements made in budget,"" he said.  On the proposed reform on accounting system, he said ""Accounting reforms for change in accounting system have already started. Audit of human resources and energy are also being undertaken.""  The minister said there is a focus on energy conservation. ""While energy audit is going on there are steps to conserve energy and to reduce energy cost,"" he said.  On the proposed Railway Regulatory Authority, Prabhu said, ""Draft is ready and we will circulate it to all stakeholders seeking their views before finalising it. However, we could change its name."""

"NEW DELHI: Intex Technologies is looking to beef up its consumer durables operations as one of India's top mobile handset makers moves to derisk its business in an intensely competitive market which is showing signs of a slowdown in the dominant and pricier smartphone segment.  The Delhi-based company expects 50% of its total revenue to come from consumer durables including televisions and washing machines by 2017-end, several notches up from about 15% in 2015, while percentage contribution from mobile phones will come down to 50%, from 80% now.  ""This year, consumer durables should contribute about 25-30%,” said Keshav Bansal, director at Intex Technologies. The company clocked revenue of Rs 6,213 crore in the fiscal ended March 2016, up 70% from Rs 3,652 crore the year before.  ""Mobile phones would have a point of saturation, and there will be ups and downs, but our focus will be equal on mobile phones and consumer durables,"" he added.  Bansal declined to comment on the company’s reported initial share sale plans to raise Rs 500-700 crore by the end of this fiscal year.  Analysts say players would have to look at mobile phones in the near term due to the high volumes, but will equally make televisions and other goods part of the portfolio as they offer slightly higher margins. Margin in phones varies between 5% and 7%. On the other hand, mobile accessories and wearables offer about 15-20% margins, therefore handset maker must have them in their product portfolios. Intex Monday launched its first virtual reality headset, which will come bundled with 4G smartphone, AquaNSE -3.45 % View.  ""Companies are looking to mitigate their risks against smartphones,” said Tarun Pathak, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, while talking about handset makers venturing into other product categories, including those that offer higher margins.  Smartphone sales in India have been slowing as consumers are holding on to their featurephones for longer periods than before, and not moving to smartphones as eagerly as they were till a couple of quarters ago. Most of smartphone sales growth is coming from existing smartphone users moving to newer models, but that isn't leading to growth in the market.  The trends were pronounced In the January-March period, when smartphone sales fell 8.2% sequentially according to International Data Corporation (IDC) India. IDC pointed to another alarming data point – the first-quarter smartphones sales were up just 5% from a year earlier, markedly slower than what it used to be. Handset makers including the top five smartphone players agree that pace of growth going forward may not be as high 20% on-year seen last year.  Intex follows India's top home-bred handset maker Micromax which recently announced that it wants to become a complete consumer durable player with 20% of its revenue coming from LED TVs, air conditioners and other products by December 2017. Intex introduced washing machines in 2013 and LED televisions last year.  Like Micromax, Intex is also expanding local manufacturing plans and will invest Rs 1,000 crore in setting up a 20 lakh sq ft plant in Greater Noida, in addition to two existing facilities. The plant will make phones to start with, followed by washing machines, televisions and other consumer goods.  Presently 80% of 2.3 million phones that it sells in India are made locally. By the year-end, Bansal said, all phones will be made in India, creating higher efficiencies and hence adding to the bottomline."

The company, which is engaged into complete turnkey solutions for solar products, components and solar power plants EPCNSE 0.59 % services starting from 1 kV to more than 100 MW, is looking to build EPC portfolio of more than 450 MW to be executed by the end of 2017 and have a IPP portfolio of more than 100 MM by 2017, he said.  ""The revenues of Rs 3,000 crore will be majorly contributed from EPC and components business. The IPP business will be contributing around 5-7 per cent of the revenue mix,"" Gupta said.  He further noted the company does not want to limit itself to be an EPC player or products manufacturer, but also wants to expand its portfolio as an independent power producer (IPP).  ""Also, we have recently ventured into rooftops segment with the developer model and we plan to aggressively ramp up this portfolio as well on build, own, operate and transfer (BOOT) model,"" Gupta said.  Jakson already has a 7 MW rooftop portfolio, which it is operating on BOOT model and plans to expand to at least 5 folds in fiscal year 2017-18.  He further said the company was in the process of increasing its manufacturing capacities of PV modules, LT panel, HT panel, module mounting structure, string combiner boxes.  ""We are in the process of ramping up our manufacturing capacities of PV modules and module mounting structures as we see a large demand supply gap in these areas,"" he said, adding, ""We are looking at both the options of expanding in the existing location and also setting up new manufacturing plants in the horizon of next 12-18 months.""  Currently, the company's manufacturing capacities portfolio includes 80 MW PV modules, 250 MW of module mounting structure, 2,000 MW of string combiner boxes and 2,000 MW of HT and LT panels, he added."

Speaking about the challenges in the Indian market, Machigad said there seems to be a lack of availability of high-end skill set and RLE plans to invest on skill development as well as leverage its global expertise to offer niche solutions in India."
"MUMBAI: It’s a classic case of putting the cart before the horse. Betting taxes, imposed by states on race clubs, are pushing bettors to indulge in ‘kerb betting’ – illegal off-course betting – which has crimped profits of turf clubs across the country.According to managers at various race clubs in the country, illegal betting has gone up 30–50 per cent over the past three years which in turn has eaten into betting volumes. For instance, annual betting volumes at Mumbai’s Royal Western India Turf Club (RWITC) slumped from about Rs 250 crore in 2011-12 to just about Rs 130 crore last fiscal. The Hyderabad Race Club, among the most profitable race clubs in the country, has seen a 15-25 per cent drop in betting volumes. Despite repeated efforts to boost the popularity of the sport (and relatively lenient betting taxes in Karnataka and West Bengal), Bangalore Turf Club and Royal Calcutta Turf Club have not managed to lift up their ‘takings’.""Our betting revenues have fallen significantly over the past four years,"" said Vivek Jain, former chairman and managing committee member of RWITC. ""Betting tax has been the killer in our case. This has prompted our patrons to shift to illegal off-the-book betting channels,"" Jain added. The Maharashtra government levies 20 per cent (up from 10 per cent a few years ago) as betting tax. In addition, RWITC also charges a 10 per cent club commission on their customers. So, if a bettor hands out Rs 100 to a bookie, only Rs 70 goes into the betting pool. The remainingRs 30 is accounted as upfront betting tax and club commission. In Karnataka, betting tax has doubled to 8 per cent, while West Bengal collects taxes at three levels: 5 per cent for betting in ‘wins and places’ (bets placed on the position of the horse at the end of the race), 10 per cent on other type of bets and 15 per cent if bets are placed through bookmakers (who provide better odds). The Hyderabad Race Club charges 12 – 15 per cent tax on bets placed with club-permitted bookies. Apart from betting tax, bet winners (above Rs 5,000) are required to pay 33 per cent income tax (including surcharges and cess) as TDS on their gains.  TWO BOOKS""These days even club-permitted bookies keep two books: one, for legal tax-paid bets and other for informal, ‘no-taxes-only-(bookie)-commission’ betting. Most people prefer to place their bets in the second book,"" said a race club manager on conditions of anonymity. ""Apart from regular bookies, there are several freelancers who pool bets informally and pay-out at the end of the race. This eludes both turf club’s account books and government’s tax ledgers,"" the race club manager said."
"NEW DELHI: Payment solutions provider Pine Labs is set to expand its operations internationally to markets like Singapore and Malaysia by the end of the year as it looks to garner revenues to the tune of Rs 500-600 crore by March 2018.  The Noida-based firm, which works with retailers and banks, aims to close the ongoing fiscal with Rs 150 crore in revenue.  ""We are looking at expansion in South East Asia, countries like Singapore and Malaysia. We have a strong market share in India in the credit/debit card market and we hope to replicate the success in these new markets as well,"" Pine Labs India CEO Lokvir Kapoor told PTI.  He added that a major chunk of the company's revenues would continue to come from India.  ""By March 2018, we are looking at revenues of Rs 500-600 crore. India would remain the big driver and in the next five years, we see India and international business to be in a similar ratio,"" he said.  Pine Labs, which provides retail POS terminals for payment acceptance, has about one lakh POS terminals in the market and aims to increase the deployment significantly.  At present, Pine Labs handles about 16-17 per cent of total cards volume (debit and credit cards) put through offline POS terminals in the country, Kapoor said.  The company has now introduced a new solution that will enable customers to pay for purchases using loyalty points accumulated across various credit and debit cards.  ""Paybypoints is a technology platform that aggregates India's top loyalty reward programmes on a single platform. Cardholders can pay for purchases and services instantly through their reward points that accrue on leading cards across a wide range of merchants,"" Kapoor said.  He added that the platform is estimated to give reward points redemption to reward point bank worth of Rs 3,000 crore held by more than 300 million card holders.  ""In India, there is a huge pile of accumulated reward points and the card holder usually ends up not utilising it as it is often a tedious process,"" he said.  The company estimates that on an average, Rs 50 crore worth of points are earned in a month while the monthly redemption is at about Rs 20 crore.  ""Giving an option to pay with points creates a great pull for card holders to Paybypoints-enabled merchants. Various marketing campaigns by banks/issuers and Pine Labs would further create the reach and the opportunity for merchants to access premium customers,"" he said.  Paybypoints has brought together issuers like Amex, Citibank, Axis BankNSE 1.60 % and PAYBACK on a single platform. The retail partners include Apple, BOSE, Samsung, The Mobile Store, Croma, Clarks, Dabur, new U, Vishal Megamart and VLCC."
"MUMBAI|DELHI: Brick-and-mortar retailers are beginning to spend more on technology and omni-channel strategies to combat the growing threat from ecommerce, a boon for tech firms who had seen revenue growth from retail decelerate in the last few years.  About 39 million Indians shop online, according to an April report by research firm AT Kearney. Though it is a small proportion of overall population, it is growing fast. Traditional retailers are realising it is a market they cannot afford to miss. Technology firms such as IBM, Oracle and SAP are gearing up to win new business.  ""In last two years, since the recent ecommerce business started, we are seeing brick-and-mortar stores are realising the need for omni-channel offerings. They have started making investments on omni-channel strategies,"" Kamal Singhani, executive director – enterprise applications and mobility leader at IBM India, told ET. Singhani added that Indian retailers would need another 12-18 months before strategies become competitive.  An omni-channel strategy implies that a retailer’s customers get the same buying experience and treatment in both physical stores, online and through mobile devices. It requires significant investment in the back-end to tie-in inventory and logistics to make it work.  Future Group has been the most vocal with its plan to spend Rs 100 crore on its omni-channel strategy over the next year. CEO Kishore Biyani has said that to implement the strategy, the retail business would have to become more technology and big data-focused. Future Group partnered with SAP to drive its omni-channel venture. Reliance Retail, Shoppers Stop, Pantaloons, and even the Tata Group are investing to win a slice of the online shopping space.  But experts say these are baby steps and retailers still have work to do on technology to compete with deeppocketed online players such as Flipkart and Amazon. ""While retailers are investing in systems, the kind of capital expenditure required to actually build the whole omni-channel experience has not happened yet,"" said Devangshu Dutta, chief executive at retail and consumer products consultancy Third Eyesight.  ""One of the first things is that they should look to move away from in-house hosted systems to cloud-based solutions. Otherwise it is very, very large investment, and time taken is significant.        "" A sales executive with a multi-national technology firm said the competition to win deals in the retail space has become increasingly fierce, as companies expect retailers to spend several hundred crores of rupees to boost their online sales.  ""For Indian retailers, the writing is on the wall. They have seen some electronics retailers struggle in India since e-commerce arrived, and now they want to defend their turf. Most haven’t pulled the trigger (on giving out contracts) but they will start,"" a sales executive with a multi-national technology company said. He declined to be identified because he is not authorised to speak to media.  Companies with analytics offering are expected to benefit greatly when the buying process begins. ""According to an industry study, the company website is the most-used method for communicating with shoppers.  Sales analytics, customer analytics and web analytics lead the way in priority order for retailers with marketing analytics not far behind,"" said Mukesh Mathur, executive director at Oracle Retail.  The Indian analytics market is expected to reach $2.3 billion by 2018, according to Nasscom, driven by increasing adoption in retail, ecommerce, banking and telecom."
"NEW DELHI: Betting big on the burgeoning Indian e-commerce market, Alcatel expects about 15 per cent of its revenues to come from online sales this year as it plans to launch a slew of mobile devices through e-tailers.  The company, which has a portfolio of seven smartphones and three feature phones, is also looking at aggressively launching more handsets through the e-commerce route.  ""We have successful partnerships with Idea and Vodafone. While we continue to grow the operator business, we are also bullish on e-commerce route to reach out to consumers,"" Alcatel One Touch Regional Director APAC Praveen Valecha told PTI.  He added that about 15 per cent of the company's revenues in India would come from e-commerce this year.  While Valecha declined to divulge revenue numbers, he said the company sold about 1.5 million handsets last year.  ""In the next four months, we will launch 5 smartphones and 2 feature phones. The Indian market has a lot of potential and is an important one for us,"" he said.  In 2014, Alcatel expects sales to touch 3 million units. Alcatel One Touch is a brand of TCL Communication, a public company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and part of TCL Corporation.  The company has launched its Idol X+ today priced at Rs 16,999 in an exclusive partnership with one of country's largest e-commerce firms, Flipkart. It will be available from June 3 onwards.  The Android Jellybean OS powered device features a five inch touchscreen, octa-core 2 GHz processor and 13.1 MP rear camera, 2MP front camera and a 2,500 mAh battery.  The box will also include a Health Boomband (smartband) and JBL headphones.  ""We expect to sell 25,000 units of Idol X+ in the first month,"" Valecha said.  Country's largest e-commerce firm, Flipkart has a similar tie up with US-based Motorola for its handsets.  ""This is the second time we are tying up with a global mobile phone brand to be the exclusive destination for their products in India. We recently witnessed massive success with another brand on our platform and this has reinforced our position as the platform of choice,"" Flipkart VP retail and head of brand relations Michael Adnani said.  Electronics, especially mobile handsets, are one of the highest selling items for the USD 3 billion e-commerce industry in India."

"KOLKATA: NTPCNSE 0.00 %, India’s leading power producer, lost Rs 3,200 crore in potential revenue during the first five months of the current fiscal due to reduced demand from the state electricity boards. The comparative figure in the year-ago period was Rs 600 crore, as per the state-run company’s estimates.  “We could not supply almost 16 billion units of energy because state electricity boards did not buy it during the first five months of the current fiscal. In contrast, last year’s figure was a small 3 billion units,” NTPC CMD Arup Roy Choudhury said in Kolkata on Monday.  As a result, 4,000-5,000 mw or 10-12% of the state-run firm’s installed capacity is lying idle, Choudhury added. However, the loss of potential revenue does not spell loss to the company, a senior official said, explaining that NTPC has saved on the coal that it would have consumed for producing additional power.  Most of the state utilities have scaled down their demand due to severe cash crunch and they are not prepared to incur further losses by selling power cheaper than their cost price, the official said.  The utilities are forced to sell the power at cheaper rates since the state electricity regulatory commissions are not always ready to give them the tariff that covers their purchase cost.  The average cost of power sold by NTPC is estimated at about Rs 2.9 per unit. This has a fixed cost, which is paid by the state utilities on the basis of the quantum of power purchase agreement and is a factor of the capex on the plant that also takes into consideration the depreciations.  The cost also has a variable component, which is paid by the utilities on the volume of the power purchased."
"KOLKATA: Godrej Appliances, a key division of Godrej & Boyce Mfg Co Ltd today said it is aiming to double its revenue from premium category products in the next one year.

"What is GMV?   GMV or gross merchandise value for e-commerce retail companies means sale price charged to the customer multiplied by the number of items sold. For example, if a company sells 10 books at Rs 100, the GMV is Rs 1,000. This is also considered as “gross revenue”. In this case, the business model is based on a retail model, where the company basically purchases the items, maintains inventory (if need be) and finally, sells or delivers the items to customers.  What is GTV? How is it different from GMV?  Gross transaction value, or GTV, is a measure used by e-commerce companies with a “market-place” where multiple sellers transact. GTV is equal to the number of items sold multiplied by the price collected. In this case, the business model is based on “commission” whereby the e-commerce company’s income is equal to a certain percentage of the GTV (GTV less costs paid to channel). In this case, the revenue is equal to income from commissions.  What does GMV/GTV indicate?  GMV/GTV is a good indicator of the growth of the company, as this measures the volume and value of merchandise sold or the number of transactions handled.  How is GMV/GTV different from revenue?  For an e-commerce company involved in e-tailing, revenue for financial reporting purposes is typically the GMV. However, in case of an e-commerce company with a “market-place” model, revenue is equal to commission earned i.e. (GTV less costs paid to channel).  How is profit determined?  For an e-commerce company involved in e-tailing, profit is equal to “revenue” less the direct costs of sales. These costs or expenses include procurement costs, discounts, payment gateway charges, logistics and delivery costs, which are deducted from “revenue” to arrive at the profit of the company.  However, in the case of an e-commerce company with a “market-place” model, profit is equal to revenue minus costs like volume discounts, marketing, payment gateway costs and other expenses.  Experts are of the view that given the focus of most e-commerce companies on building scale and acquiring customers, they have to provide incentives such as discounts and free delivery to acquire new customers. These “customer acquisition” costs can be high, which in turn impacts short-term profitability, but provides scale and growth in revenue,” said Raja Lahiri, partner at advisory firm Grant Thornton."
"Multiplex companies present a picture of healthy consolidation as they have recorded a significant improvement in their revenues per screen per quarter and operating margins after expanding inorganically over the past three years.PVR and Inox Leisure have reported a growth of 28-58% in revenues per screen per quarter since their respective acquisitions.The growth has come from a combination of factors, including consistent increase in average ticket prices, increasing contribution of revenues from food & beverages as well as advertising segments, expansion in non-metro cities and, perhaps most important, their bargaining power with producer-distributor groupings that share part of the revenues from sale of tickets.There have been two major acquisitions in the multiplex industry over the past three years. Inox Leisure acquired Fame India in 2010, a move that strengthened its presence in western, southern and eastern regions. PVR acquired Cinemax India in November last year, thereby consolidating its presence in the western region considerably after having established itself in the North. Prior to the acquisition, Inox Leisure and Fame India individually generated average revenues per screen per quarter of Rs 59 lakh and Rs 41 lakh, respectively, from June 2009 to June 2010. The merged entity has been recording an increase in average revenue per screen per quarter. According to an ETIG analysis, the average revenue per screen per quarter for Inox Leisure has increased to Rs 79 lakh after acquisition, leading to a growth of 58% in average revenue per screen per quarter in the quarter to September 2013.Similarly, PVR and Cinemax India individually generated average revenues per screen per quarter of Rs 86 lakh and Rs 57 lakh, respectively, from June 2010 to December 2012. The merged entity has generated Rs 91 lakh revenue per screen per quarter in the quarter to September 2013, spelling a growth of 28%.“Besides robust box-office collections (with a consistent growth of 7-8% in average ticket prices), a major factor that contributed to the growth of revenue per screen per quarter is the strong growth in food & beverages revenues in the last three years,” said Nitin Sood, chief financial officer of PVR.Among the chief reasons for growth in revenues from food & beverages is the frequent change in the food menu. “At Inox, apart from usual snacks, we constantly innovate on our food menu. We have different varieties of sandwiches and other items, which are improvised according to the changing taste of patrons,” said Alok Tandon, chief executive officer of Inox Leisure. The contribution of food & beverages to the company’s revenues in April-September 2013 was 21%, compared with 15% in the corresponding period in 2010.										  			Consistent increase in advertising revenues also contributed to the growth in revenues per screen per quarter as multiplexes increased their presence across the country. Inox Leisure is present in 40 cities with 288 screens, while PVR is present in 38 cities with 402 screens after their respective acquisitions. This has added to the advertising revenues as well, which, in turn, enhanced revenues per screen per quarter. “Due to enhanced presence in tier-II and tier-III cities, our advertising revenues are also growing by 30% year-on-year for the last three years,” said PVR’s Sood. Analysts, however, say the increased bargaining power of exhibition companies is the biggest driver of their growth. Multiplex companies get half of the revenues earned from sale of tickets during the first week of release of a film, while the rest goes to producer-distributor entities. In the subsequent weeks, the share of revenues changes between multiplexes and producer-distributor entities depending on the collections."
"NEW DELHI: Bharti Airtel, India's largest mobile operator by both customers and sales, has recorded a 1.1% jump in its revenue market share for the three months ended June 2012, after continuous decline in this parameter for nine consecutive quarters, indicating that its new strategy of aggressively pricing its services is beginning to yield results.  An analysis of the latest data released by sector regulator Trai reveals that Bharti commanded 30.3% of the industry's sales for the June 2012 quarter when compared to 29.2% for the previous three-month period in the same year (Jan-March 2012). Its peers - Vodafone and IdeaNSE -1.23 % Cellular - that have been chipping away at its dominance in the mobility space in India for the last two years have retained their revenue market share at 22.7% and 15%, respectively, during this period.  Bharti's revenue market share (RMS) fell from 33.8% in the first quarter of 2009-10 to 29.2% in the fourth quarter of 2011-12 while Vodafone increased its RMS by 200 basis points and Idea Cellular by 280 basis points during the same period.  The Sunil Mittal-promoted telco had first responded to increased competitive intensity by increasing tariffs last year, but gave up this strategy by December 2011 as it had led to reduced cellphone usage by customers. The telco, 33% owned by SingTel, tweaked its pricing strategy across all key regions earlier this year, including taking the lead in reducing high-end data prices (3G) by up to 70% to improve its revenue market share.  Earlier this month, after posting a tenth straight quarterly fall in profits, its management said the company had consciously decided to play the price factor despite running the risk of having to take a big cut in margins to regain its RMS in the short-term. Sanjay Kapoor, the company's CEO for India and South Asia, had told analysts post the results that company had adopted a mark-to-market pricing strategy to claw back lost ground.  ""New strategy results in RMS gains finally for Bharti. The RMS focus was matched by being more competitive in selective pockets, particularly western India and an aggressive network rollout all across, particularly 900 circles. We note that RMS gains have been supported by a 30 basis points improvement in subscriber market share as well,"" HSBC Global Research said in an August 24 note to its clients.  In a report released this weekend and titled 'Bharti fights back', analysts Suresh Madhavan and Varun Ahuja with UBS Investment Research said: ""Bharti gained revenue share in all service areas and continues to lead the market with revenue share of 30.3%. Idea lost 41 bps in service area 'A' which was offset by 56 bps gain in service area 'C' and maintained share in Metro and service area 'B'. Vodafone lost share in Metro (-35 bps) and service area 'A' while gained 14 bps/99 bps in service areas 'B'/'C', respectively. RCOM lost 50-200 bps in all service areas. Uninor and Aircel gained share in all service areas."" The UBS report said that Indian consumers had already 'decided in favour of Bharti, Vodafone and Idea and these three operators jointly had a 68% revenue market share'. ""Therefore, the industry looks likely to consolidate to a maximum of five operators in the medium term,"" the report added.  Despite the improved performance, Bharti's shares are currently trading close to a six-year low with investors fleeing the company, after it stock was recently downgraded by leading brokerages such as Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Standard Chartered and Morgan Stanley, who cited concerns ranging from internal performance to regulatory and competitive threats.  Trai's data also reveals that RCOM recorded a 1.2% dip in its revenue market share during the June quarter while Tata TeleservicesNSE 1.64 % lost about 0.2%. RCOM now accounts for only 7.1% of the total revenues in Indian's mobile space when compared to 11.5% share in Jan-March 2010 period.  Analysts, however, continue to be critical of Bharti and point out that its growth in traffic has come at the expense of operating margins.  ""Though Bharti's net add market share in India has risen from 14% in F2Q12 to over 40% in F1Q13, it has come at the cost of lower margins. Thus, growth in traffic for the sector is not as good as we previously expected,"" analysts Vinay Jaising, Anirban Roy and Vanessa A D'Souza at Morgan Stanley said in a August 20 note to their clients. The note also added that despite a up to 70% reduction in 3G tariffs, data growth was on the decline. Bharti's margins in the mobile space has fallen by about 370 bps in the June quarter.  ""This stands out from other telcos and shows vulnerability of the largest operator in protecting its market share. This is likely to continue near-term as reflected in our muted margin assumption,"" analysts Gaurav Malhotra and Arthur Pineda of City Research, said in a recent note, even as they maintained that Bharti stock was 'still a buy'.  In an August 9 note, HSBC Global Research had said that Bharti's change in strategy to focus on RMS has prompted this increased investment, which may hurt longer-term profitability given the fact that there is not much voice growth left."
"KOLKATA: Some six years after it first showed a commercial where two children squeeze through international barriers to play soccer, Bharti AirtelNSE -1.27 % says the beautiful game has helped it connect with the African youth and boost revenues.  ‘Airtel Rising Stars’ soccer talent hunt campaign has helped India’s largest mobile phone company post a near 40% jump in data traffic across its troubled African operations over the past nine months. “Airtel Rising Stars initiative has given us a platform to connect with the African youth who are a huge driver of data services,” Andre Beyers, chief marketing officer (Africa), Bharti Airtel, told ET.  “Our football content revenue has grown by millions of dollars, especially as the African youth is increasingly accessing our football platforms over our 3G network,” he added.  The Sunil Mittal-promoted telco’s revenue growth in Africa has been lower than expected, but company executives said the Rising Stars campaign has triggered a 20% growth in its data ARPU to $1.2 (Rs 66 approx) with local youth guzzling its football content.  Youth comprise a meaty 38% of Airtel’s 67 million customers in Africa. A spokesman of global brand research agency Millward & Brown said its brand health studies revealed a high awareness of Airtel Rising Stars executions and activations in Africa with an estimated 67 million claim to be aware of the communication.  “From a brand point of view, the data indicated a positive impact of Airtel Rising Stars in building a stronger brand relationship with the youth in markets like Kenya, Nigeria, Zambia and Congo,” he said.  While CMO Beyers declined to reveal specific revenue or data growth numbers for Airtel in Africa, company executives said data usage across Airtel’s 17-nation African footprint shot up 99% after the rollout of the Rising Stars brand campaign. They say that with soccer is gaining popularity rapidly in India and data usage too on the rise, the company now looks to replicate the African success with the Rising Stars campaign in the home country.                      “Football, particularly the European leagues, is getting increasingly popular with Indian youth and the Airtel Rising Stars platform gives us a great opportunity to connect with them,” a top Airtel executive said, requesting not to be named.  “Data traffic has more than doubled in the past one year,” the person said. The Airtel Rising Stars campaign in India promises a 7-day training camp at Manchester United ground to 12 under-16 talents from India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. It has close to 2 million Facebook likes.  Brands specialists like Harish Bijoor, however, are sceptical about the mass success of such initiatives in India where data services consumption remains largely “corporate-driven”.  “I’m not surprised about African youth’s appetite for football content delivered over a 3G network, and the same thing can work for Airtel in India too, provided the mass data consumption profile changes from corporate-driven to consumer-driven as is the case in most western markets and Africa, too,” Bijoor said. He said 3G rates will have to come down for a consumer-driven data consumption pattern to emerge in the country.  “Indian telcos still rely largely on corporates to grow data revenues, unlike in several African markets where the common consumer drives data consumption since 3G rates are lower,” he said.  Industry analysts believe India’s move to regulate 3G roaming pacts between the top three mobile phone companies — Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea CellularNSE -1.23 % — in regions where they don’t own third-generation airwaves could hurt the pan-India traction of 3G data services."
"KOLKATA: Malaysia’s Axiata Group Berhad has renounced its shares entitlement in Vodafone Idea’s ongoing Rs 25,000 crore rights issue in favour of global investors, a move which will bring down its stake in India’s largest telecom operator to 2.6% from 8.1%.“Axiata has renounced its rights entitlements in favour of investors through transactions on BSE,” a Vodafone IdeaNSE -1.23 % spokesperson told ET, adding that investors keen to participate in the telco’s rights issue “have acquired the rights renunciations on the exchange, which shows their interest in VIL and its issue”.A senior Vodafone Idea Limited (VIL) executive said on condition of anonymity that several investors had reached out to bankers and the company, expressing interest in buying rights renunciations, if available.Separately, a person aware of the matter said that Axiata Group’s non-participation won't hurt VIL’s rights issue as the Malaysian telco’s “renounced rights entitlement is learnt to have already been oversubscribed more than three times by global investors, translating into demand worth $1 billion”.ET had reported on April 10 that Axiata Group was likely to skip the VIL rights issue.Till press time, Axiata Group did not reveal the names of the specific investor entities in whose favour it had renounced its rights entitlement.Earlier this week, a spokeswoman of the group had told ET that as financial investors to VIL, the Malaysian telco had no intention of exiting the Indian market at this juncture.VIL’s rights issue opened on Wednesday (April 10) and closes on April 24. The entitlement ratio is 87 equity shares for every 38 held by eligible shareholders as of April 2. The company’s board has priced the rights issue aggressively at Rs 12.50 a share. The company stock ended 1.53% lower at Rs 16.05 on the BSE on Friday.Vodafone Group and the Aditya Birla Group will infuse up to Rs 11,000 crore and Rs 7,250 crore, respectively, via the rights issue. They have also committed to subscribe to part or the whole of any unsubscribed portion.VIL intends to spend Rs 18,674.79 crore out of the Rs 25,000 crore it raises from its rights issue – the largest ever in India – on repaying debt and paying spectrum dues. It will use Rs 6,220 crore for general expenses, according to a regulatory filing with the stock exchanges.The company’s focus will be on profitable districts, ways of reducing operating expenditure and improving average revenue per user, a key performance indicator that plummeted after the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm in September 2016.VIL’s leadership expects the combination of the rights issue proceeds and monetisation of its 11.15% stake in Indus Towers will allow the company to make the required investments in the telecom business to achieve strategic goals.At present, the telco lags rivals Jio and Bharti Airtel in terms of 4G coverage. It expects to use the funds to pare its over-Rs 1.14 lakh-crore debt and free up cash to invest in expanding its 4G coverage, which is critical in its battle for subscribers.The telecom market leader has been steadily losing users and, as per the latest data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, it lost as many as 3.6 million users in January while both Jio and Bharti Airtel gained users during the month."
"Kolkata: Malaysia’s Axiata Group Berhad is unlikely to participate in Vodafone Idea’s Rs 25,000 crore rights issue, reducing its stake in the company from 8.1% to roughly 2.6%, people familiar with the matter said.“Axiata hasn’t made any material investments into Idea CellularNSE -1.23 % over the years and also not in Vodafone Idea,” said one person.The Malaysian telco did not respond to ET’s queries on whether it would participate in the rights issue or renounce its shares in favour of promoters Aditya Birla Group and UK’s Vodafone Group Plc. However, the company indicated it will remain invested in Vodafone Idea.“As financial investors to Vodafone Idea,” Axiata has “no intention of exiting the India market at this juncture,” a spokeswoman of Axiata Group told ET.Axiata’s unlikely participation won’t adversely affect the Vodafone Idea rights issue, the people said.“Should Axiata not subscribe to its portion of the rights subscription, we expect other financial investors to acquire its portion as there was tremendous investor interest for the issue during roadshows across three continents,” another person with knowledge of the matter said. “It’s (the issue) likely to be oversubscribed.”Vodafone Idea (VIL) didn’t respond to ET’s emailed queries. The company was formed by the merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular in August.The Aditya Birla Group holds a 26.55% stake in VIL, while Vodafone Group has 44.78%. The combined promoter stake is expected to increase to 72.5% from 71.33% now and could rise further if Axiata renounces its shares, partly or fully, in their favour.Vodafone Group and the Aditya Birla Group will infuse up to Rs 11,000 crore and Rs 7,250 crore, respectively, via the rights issue. They have committed to subscribe to part or the whole of any unsubscribed portion.The rights issue opens Wednesday and closes on April 24. The entitlement ratio is 87 equity shares for every 38 held by eligible shareholders as of April 2.VIL’s board priced the rights issue at Rs 12.50 a share. The company stock declined 1.7% to Rs 16.90 at the close on the BSE on Tuesday.“Proceeds from the rights issue coupled with monetisation of our stake in Indus Towers will allow us to make the required investments in the business to achieve our strategic goals,” VIL CEO Balesh Sharma said in a statement Tuesday. The company expects to get some Rs 5500 crore from the Indus stake sale expected in the next three to four months.Vodafone Idea intends to spend Rs 18,674.79 crore of the Rs 25,000 crore it raises from its rights issue – the largest ever in India – on repaying debt and paying spectrum dues. It will use Rs 6,220 crore for general expenses, according to a document filed with the exchanges.As per the document, the company’s focus will be on profitable districts, ways of reducing operating expenditure and improving average revenue per user, a key performance indicator that plummeted after the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm in September 2016.“As part of our current strategy, we have segregated districts in India based on their growth potential and revenue and EBITDA contribution to our company, instead of following a conventional approach and focusing on service areas,” the company said.It added that in non-profitable districts, it plans to shut down the weaker of the two networks, which will enable the company to incur operating expenses for one network while generating revenue from customers of both brands. The company plans to continue with both the Vodafone and Idea brands."
"Zomato released its report for FY 19 a few days ago. It gives an insight into the food preference of Indians in the 200 cities where the food delivery platform operates.Some of the findings are truly eye-opening. For example, a delivery boy had to take a boat across the Brahmaputra to deliver an order to a place near Guwahati.On one occasion, some person in Alwar placed 292 orders with 48 different restaurants. In Jaipur, as many as 415 boxes were required to make a delivery worth Rs 1,84,760.In one of the most surprising finds, Indore beat a big metro like Mumbai — the city that never sleeps — in midnight delivery of food.When it comes to breakfast, Vijaywada in Andhra Pradesh beats all other cities hands down. According to Zomato's figures, this city's love for breakfast is way more than any other place in India.According to the report, Ooty pays the highest average bill per order. Zomato patrons from Manipal are the most frequent in terms of placing food orders. Madurai is where people look up chicken biryani the most.Did you know of any place where bicycles outnumber motorcycles vastly as delivery vehicles? Well, now you know. In Bihar's Gaya and Bhagalpur, Zomato has way more bicycle-riding delivery boys than bike-borne ones.Gujarat's Anand is the place where pizza is the most popular order. Zomato users in Jammu are the most likely to order fast food among tier-3 cities. Among tier-2 cities, Ahmedabad saw the most number of orders being delivered.Kota in Rajasthan is the largest emerging city for the food delivery app. Tuni in Andhra Pradesh is the smallest emerging city. The small town from Andhra is also the most cashless, Zomato noted in its report. Credit: Zomato annual report Gurgaon-based Zomato currently operates in more than 200 cities. It has over 100,000 restaurant listings in India. In March 2019, it registered more than 30 million deliveries. For FY 19, Zomato logged an annual run-rate GMV of over $1.5 billion, according to the annual report.More and more people now go online to book tables not only in India but globally, Zomato boss Deepinder Goyal said. He said Zomato's reservation services are now offered in eight countries across over 16,000 restaurants, and that more than 1 million diners in India are making reservations on Zomato every month.Zomato saw a three-fold jump in revenue at $206 million for 2018-2019, which makes for a loss of $294 million, Goyal said. ""We now lose Rs 25 per delivery, compared to Rs 44 per delivery in March 2018. Our last mile cost per delivery is now Rs 65, compared to Rs 86 in March last year. The number of deliveries per rider per hour has gone up to 1.4 from 0.9 last year,"" he added.India's food delivery businesses are quickly scaling up to cater to the needs of the fast-growing breed of short-on-time customers. The trend is only expected to go up with each passing year."
"NEW DELHI | MUMBAI: Patanjali Ayurved’s proposed acquisition of Ruchi SoyaNSE 4.32 % has reached the final stages with the Committee of Creditors (CoC) meeting on Tuesday to clear the proposed deal, two officials directly aware of the developments said.“The deal is likely to be announced this month,” one of the officials mentioned above, said.Patanjali Ayurved spokesperson SK Tijarawala confirmed the committee of creditors meeting on Tuesday but declined to comment on details.An email sent to Ruchi Soya’s spokesperson remained unanswered till press time.Last month, the Baba Ramdev led Patanjali revised its offer to acquire the debt-laden Ruchi Soya Industries to Rs 4,350 crore, Rs 200 crore more than it had offered earlier and topping Adani Wilmar's bid of Rs 4,100 crore.Of the Rs 4,350 crore, Rs 115 crore will come as company equity, while the balance Rs 4,235 crore will be distributed among financial creditors. Public sector lenders IDBI Bank and SBI have the highest exposure to Ruchi Soya, the bankrupt edible oil company. Adani Wilmar was the other bidder, but withdrew recently citing delay in completion of the insolvency process.  “Patanjali will submit details of the distribution of Rs 4,235 crore to financial creditors in a couple of days,” said an official close to the development. “The committee of creditors will meet in the third week of April again to discuss the disbursal of funds,” he added.Packaged foods maker Ruchi Soya, saddled with an overall debt of close to Rs 12,000 crore, owns brands such as Nutrela, Mahakosh, Sunrich, Ruchi Star and Ruchi Gold. At the end of 2017, the debt-laden company was referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) following petitions from creditors Standard Chartered Bank and DBS Bank.For the Haridwar-based Patanjali Ayurved, which approached the NCLT against the lenders’ decision in favour of Adani Wilmar, the potential acquisition of Ruchi Soya will be its biggest.Shailendra Ajmera is the resolution professional (RP) appointed by NCLT on the application of creditors Standard Chartered Bank and DBS Bank under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.Patanjali Ayurved, which makes staples, personal care and packaged foods, saw revenues for the year ended March 2018 decline 10% to Rs 8,135 crore from Rs 9,030 crore in FY17 after five years of impressive growth, according to data from research platform Tofler. Company chief executive Acharya Balkrishna had attributed the slowing sales to its supply chain and distribution network not being able to keep pace with its growth, in addition to internal restructuring.The potential acquisition of Ruchi Soya will help the ayurveda bellwether gain captive brand share, the largest oil seed extraction capacity in the country, and 24 plants of crushing, milling, refining and packaging edible oils. Ruchi Soya is also one of the country’s largest exporters of valueadded soy products."
"By Rajesh Kumar Singh & Vrishti BeniwalIndia is witnessing a listless growth in electricity demand, possibly signaling more slowdown in Asia’s third-largest economy.Electricity requirement from distribution utilities in February rose 1.3 percent from a year earlier and barely changed from January’s 1.1 percent, the weakest growth in two years, according to the power ministry’s Central Electricity Authority. Data for power generation, a proxy for demand, showed the weakness continued into March.The trend points to a lack of appetite among factories and commercial firms -- who consume about half the country’s electricity -- ahead of government data on industrial production for February that’s due Friday. Uncertainty about the outcome of a national election beginning Thursday, weak domestic demand and a global slowdown have clouded India’s economy.  Economic growth slowed to 6.6 percent in the three months to December, the weakest pace in six quarters. The International Monetary Fund Tuesday cut the nation’s growth outlook for this year to 7.3 percent from 7.5 percent seen in January.“The industry is not growing at a fast pace,” said Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist, at India Ratings and Research, the local unit of Fitch Group. “All leading indicators suggest sluggishness in industrial activities will continue for some time.”India’s core infrastructureNSE -0.27 % sector, which constitutes 40 percent of total industrial production, grew 2.1 percent in February, marginally improving from January’s 19-month low of 1.8 percent when electricity generation and production of refinery products contracted.Hurting ReformsWhile factory output data for March, which is published with a one-month lag, is due in May, early indicators point to a steepening slowdown. Local passenger vehicle sales have contracted for five straight months to March, while exports growth has been sluggish.The weakening demand and generation also hurts an electricity distribution reform that sought to revive ailing power retailers. That move was critical to fulfilling the government’s promise of providing electricity to the masses.The utilities, which had piled up more than 4 trillion rupees ($58 billion) of debt as they were forced to sell electricity at subsidized rates to farmers and poor households, depend on commercial users for revenue to maintain financial health. With that demand teetering, retailers may cut purchases, leaving power plants running below capacity.“Weak demand from unsubsidized industrial and commercial customers weakens the financial health of the distribution companies,” said R. Srikanth, a professor for energy and natural resources at Bengaluru-based National Institute of Advanced Studies. It “has a spiraling effect on the entire sector and the economy.”"

"Deloitte India is in the process of shortlisting an independent law firm to review allegations made by an unnamed whistleblower who claimed the firm helped fudging IL&FS Financial Services (IFIN) accounts.The law firm, when finalised, will look into the allegations made by the whistleblower through a media portal — Moneylife — on Wednesday. The law firm would review the letter written by the unknown whistleblower and the merits of the allegations. The whistleblower, who claimed to be part of Deloitte India, had written the letter to Moneylife.“Senior management team at Deloitte, Haskins and Sells LLP (Deloitte),” has been “privy to several internal irregularities in providing professional services to the IL&FS (Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services) Group,” the whistleblower apparently told the news portal.According to the people ET spoke to, there is a suspicion that the whistleblower may not be working with Deloitte. “He has got some basic facts wrong,” said a person requesting anonymity.

Also, the whistleblower (or the portal) refers to the global CEO of Deloitte as India head, a mistake, claimed the person quoted above, “no Deloitte employee would commit.”The review by the law firm would also look into allegations against a senior tax consultant.Deloitte India had bought an Indian firm with a distinct focus on taxation in 2017.The senior tax consultant joined the firm with his team members after the acquisition."
"Banks are facing fresh challenges in mobilising deposits as their non-bank rivals are attracting savers with higher returns on bonds.Aggregate deposits of banks have shrunk by Rs 4410 crore in the fortnight ending March 15, and with about half-a-dozen NBFCs looking to mop up about Rs 3000 crore in non-convertible debentures (NCD), banks have their task cut out to keep the flow intact.Small savers have also shifted their preference to equities and mutual funds, which has forced banks to hold on the deposit rates despite Reserve Bank of India’s signal for a softer interest rate cycle. They have now to compete with Srei Infrastructure FinanceNSE 0.17 %, Magma FincorpNSE -0.25 %, Shriram City Union Finance and MuthootNSE 0.82 % Homefin which look to raise about Rs 2050 crore between them in the next three weeks.L&T Finance has already concluded its Rs 1000-crore fund raising through NCDs.""In light of the recent rate cuts by RBI, well priced NCDs have become a preferred choice of retail investors,” said Rakesh Bhutoria, chief executive officer at Srei, which is looking to raise Rs 500 crore in bond sales.These companies are offering coupon ranging from 8.6% to 10.75%, much higher than what banks offer. State Bank of IndiaNSE 0.11 % offers a maximum 6.85% for five-year deposits while Bandhan BankNSE -1.05 % offers a maximum of 7.65% for 18 months to less than two-year deposits.Although RBI data suggested squeeze in bank deposits in the past reporting fortnight, long term trend showed 10% annual growth, which is broadly similar to pre-demonetization levels but still lags loan growth, Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note.“The main challenge remains in the structure of the deposits and lending markets where the shift in market share on deposits has been slower to private banks compared to loans, especially large-ticket corporate loans,” the research note said.While competition has prevented banks from lowering deposit rates, the tighter liquidity conditions have forced NBFCs offer higher rates on NCDs.Shriram City Union Finance is in the market to raise Rs 750 crore with Magma looking to garner Rs 500 crore and Muthoot Homefin another Rs 300 crore.

"A 93-year-old bank in Tamil Nadu is moving to Mumbai. The boards of Lakshmi Vilas BankNSE 0.83 % (LVB) and IndiabullsNSE -3.43 % Housing Finance this week approved the merger between the two to create what would be known as the ‘Indiabulls Lakshmi Vilas Bank’, with a combined loan book of Rs 1.23 lakh crore.The merger ends a decade-old institution, started by a group of businessmen to promote trade in western Tamil Nadu. LVB has been hit by rising bad loans over the past one year, depleting its capital adequacy ratio, which dropped to 7.57% at the end of December 2018 from 9.67% three months ago. The bank has made losses for five successive quarters, forcing it to raise capital through a hurried QIP a few days ago.In came the white knight in Indiabulls Housing Finance. Now the merged entity - Indiabulls Lakshmi Vilas Bank - will shift headquarters to Mumbai with Indiabulls chairman Sameer Gehlaut as the possible vice chairman of the new entity. Dismissing calls of selling out an orphaned child, current MD and CEO Parthasarathi Mukherjee told TOI that the new deal will give wings to the bank. ""I would say we found a rich parent."" The deal structure gives the shareholders of Lakshmi Vilas Bank 14 shares of Indiabulls Housing FinanceNSE 0.11 % for every 100 shares held — about a 40% premium to LVB’s closing price on Thursday.Started by a group of seven businessmen of Karur under the leadership of V S N Ramalinga Chettiar in 1926, the bank was formed to cater to the financial needs of the people in and around the town who were occupied in trading businesses, industry and agriculture.LVB's troubles multiplied after it disbursed loans amounting to around Rs 720 crore to the investment arms of Malvinder Singh and Shivinder Singh, former promoters of pharma major Ranbaxy and Fortis HealthcareNSE 1.54 %, against fixed deposits (FDs) of Rs 794 crore made with the bank by Religare Finvest in late 2016 and early 2017. Religare was promoted by the Singh brothers. Religare later sued the Delhi branch of LVB after the bank invoked the FDs to recover the loans. The issue is in the courts. ""The bank grew while it was operating out of Karur. In 2014, the headquarters was shifted to Chennai from Karur, and ever since the bank's downhill journey started,"" a retired general manager of the bank told TOI. ""It was small, working on a set mandate and content. The aggression to grow killed it.""This deal may now raise expectations of more such transactions at south India-based banks that require capital but have large deposit franchises.""Since it had its roots in a small town, the bank was built by forging a strong relationship with customers,"" said a former employee of LVB. Though he had left the bank almost a decade ago, he still nurtures the relationships he built during his stint there. ""This has happened because of the NPAs. But it is an excellent bank and I am sure it would bounce back,"" he said. ""For long, Karur was linked to two banks - Karur Vysya BankNSE 0.06 % and LVB. One is gone now. Needless aggressive lending to grab market share has resulted in this downfall,"" N Mahalingam, a small trader in Karur, told TOI. His family owns shares in LVB."
"The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, the sector watchdog, has lobbed the ball back into the government’s court on 4G spectrum allocation sans auction to state-owned operators Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) and Mahanagar Telephone NigamNSE -1.64 % Ltd (MTNL).Trai has told the telecom department that allocation of the coveted spectrum to the public sector entities without calling for auctions was a policy decision of the government and that it had no role in it.“Earlier this week, Trai wrote to the DoT (Department of Telecommunication) that the allocation of the spectrum to public-owned entities is an administrative matter and the government would be in the best position to dispose of the matter,” a senior DoT official said.A query to DoT did not elicit any response.The allotment of 4G spectrum — a key component of the revival package for the two state-run telecom carriers — is crucial for the loss-making telecom firms to compete with private sector rivals such as Reliance Jio, Bharti AirtelNSE -1.27 % and Vodafone Idea.The telecom department had last month sought Trai’s views on whether spectrum — a natural resource — could be allocated to the two ailing firms ‘administratively’, or without the process of going through an auction. In 2012, the apex court, while quashing 122 telecom licences, said that all natural resources should be allocated only through auctions.The government has also sought approval from the Election Commission of India, in view of the ongoing general elections, to put the radio waves allocation matter before the Cabinet, following pressure from the two service providers’ nearly 2 lakh employees.The non-availability of 4G airwaves to public sector companies, at a time when the private sector is closer to embracing the next-generation 5G technology, is bleeding the companies further as subscribers desert the state-run carriers for rivals, putting their revival at risk.The two telecom firms - BSNL operates across 22 telecom circles and MTNL serves Delhi and Mumbai - are demanding that the government approve their revival proposals, which include a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS), asset monetization and allocation of 4G spectrum.Recently, the All India Trade Union Congress alleged that a deliberate attempt was being made to shut down BSNL."

He is currently serving notice period which is technically up to May-end, but may leave the company by the end of April.Kalra quit a couple of months back.Prior to these resignations, Suniti Bhat, Director Oil & Gas and Member – Executive Committee at the company, resigned about six months back which was followed by the firm's chief internal audit and risk assurance director Arup Chakraborty quitting the company.A company spokesperson confirming the resignations said: ""Such movements in management are part of natural evolution in any organization, and are in line with career aspirations and personal priorities of individuals.""Having a strong and healthy leadership pipeline is the key in a high growth organisation like ours. We want to emphasise here that these movements are unconnected and have been spread over a period of time.""Mathur did not answer phone calls made to seek his comments.Mathur, 58, joined Cairn India in January 2013 and was named interim CEO when Mayank Ashar resigned as the chief executive of the company in May 2016.He continued as interim CEO till the time Cairn India remained a separate listed company under Vedanta Ltd. He was elevated as chief executive officer of oil and gas business at Vedanta Ltd last year when Cairn India was merged with its parent Vedanta Ltd.Sources said the company has named Ajay Dixit, who was CEO of aluminum and power divisions of Vedanta, to take over from Mathur in the interim period after his exit.The resignations came within months of Vedanta winning 41 out of the 55 exploration blocks bid out in India's first bid round under open acreage licensing policy. Some in the industry saw its bids as an attempt to please the establishment as the bid round would have collapsed with state-owned explorers like ONGC and Oil India Ltd (OIL) putting limited bids and other private and foreign players staying out of the bid round.They felt Vedanta had over-committed itself to not so prospective blocks and with a limited team.Mathur is the fourth CEO to have quit the company since Vedanta completed the acquisition of Cairn India in December 2011.Rahul Dhir, the company's first CEO who oversaw its listing and development of India's biggest oil discovery in Rajasthan, quit the company in August 2012. His successor P Elango resigned in May 2014, while the third CEO Mayank Ashar resigned in May 2016.Elango's exit in 2014 had completed the exodus of the entire top management of Cairn India since Vedanta announced its intention in 2010 to buy a majority stake in the company from Scottish explorer Cairn Energy Plc.Rick Bott, who was the executive director and the chief operating officer of Cairn India, quit on June 15, 2011. Indrajit Banerjee, executive director and chief financial officer, resigned with effect from August 23, 2011.David Ginger, Cairn India's director of exploration and new ventures, quit shortly after that. Dhir put in his paper after the Cairn-Vedanta deal was completed.Director, Commercial and New Business Ajay Gupta quit the firm in January 2013.In February 2014, Sundeep Bhandari, the man credited with laying the foundation and then building what is now Cairn India, quit the company. He along with Dhir, Bott, Banerjee and Ginger ran the firm before Vedanta took over.Vedanta had bought 58.8 per cent stake in Cairn India from British explorer Cairn Energy for USD 8.67 billion in August 2010 and the acquisition was completed in December 2011.In April 2017, Cairn India was merged with Vedanta and delisted from the stock exchanges."
"PUNE: Zoho Corp has announced the launch of Zoho Commerce, an e-commerce solution which will help small retailers set up their own ecommerce sites. Hyther Nizam, vp-product management, Zoho Corp said that the company had been running a beta version for the past year with 3,500 retailers globally, about 10% of which were in India. “People want to move away from marketplaces and have more control over their online sales and improve their margins,” he said. The product would be integrated with existing Zoho backend solutions like Zoho Books (accounting software) and Campaigns, an email campaign software. There are over 480 million internet users in India, and this number will grow to over 600 million by 2021.

Nizam said that unlike existing companies that offered the same service where the retail pays on a per transaction basis, they would charge a flat monthly fee on a monthly gross merchandise value (GMV) of upto Rs 25 lakhs. “We want to disrupt the marketplace and will take a bottom up approach, starting with small and medium retailers,” said Nizam. The company would also educate the merchants in how to increase traffic to their website, run email campaigns and on social media marketing.Zoho currently has over 40 products across different business categories, including sales and marketing, customer support and accounting."
"Cash-strapped Jet AirwaysNSE -0.11 % has for now suspended all its international flights and continues to cut down on domestic operations, raising doubts about its survival.The airline had over the last few months suspended operations to more than 15 short haul international destinations in the Gulf, south east Asia and SAARC countries. Between Wednesday and Thursday, it cancelled flights to Singapore and Kathmandu. Thursday evening, it cancelled the remaining overseas flights to Amsterdam, Paris and London.A Jet Airways spokesperson said all long-haul west bound departures have been cancelled till tomorrow morning. She didn’t elaborate.In a separate statement, Jet said a flight from Mumbai to Kolkata, from Kolkata to Guwahati and from Dehradun to Kolkata via Guwahati have been cancelled. Jet has grounded more than 80% of its planes from 124 in December. It has defaulted on loans, delayed rentals to lessors, payments to vendors including fuel suppliers and laid off staff. It has been operating less than 20 planes on domestic routes.   An Indian airline must fly 20 or more to operate overseas flights. The total number of operational aircraft fell to 14 on Thursday, people in the know said. The country’s aviation regulator the Directorate General of Civil Aviation has been monitoring its operations and assessing its eligibility to fly abroad.Jet’s cancellations have affected millions of passengers over the last few months. Its call centres have been dysfunctional and irate passengers have poured their fury over Twitter and other social media. Its lenders are fervently looking for an investor for the airline. Even if it happens, the credibility of the brand will take longer to resurrect. Jet owes more than Rs 3,500 crore to passengers whose flights have been cancelled, according to government estimates.Jet Thursday also stopped selling tickets on the long haul flights on its western routes for the next seven days so that passengers stranded at Amsterdam, Paris and London can be flown back to India, said a person close to the development.Jet needs urgent cash to survive. It was supposed to get Rs 1,500 crore in terms of interim loan funding and hasn’t received it. As of Thursday night, there was no decision on part of the lenders to release money, said a person in the know.Yesterday, state-run oil refiner Indian Oil Corp suspended fuel supplies to Jet between 3 pm and 8:30 pm causing a disruption in flights. Supplies and operations resumed shortly after. Separately, a cargo agent seized cargo from a Boeing 777 flight operating from Amsterdam. A Jet spokespersonsaid the flight was cancelled and passengers re-accomodated. He didn’t elaborate.Etihad Airways, which owns 24% of Jet, Thursday submitted an expression of interest to invest in Jet."
"NEW DELHI | KOLKATA: Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Retail is betting big on business-to-business (B2B) ecommerce with a digital wholesale marketplace along the lines of China’s Alibaba for products such as smartphones, televisions, garments, spices and soap, according to people aware of the plan. It’s looking to service a range of retailers, including those located in remote villages, they said.The company has already started trials in Bengaluru for apparel through Ajio Business, which plans to enrol more than 50,000 vendors in the coming months, the executives said. The pilot will shortly be extended to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, they said. It will kick off proceedings in the Mumbai market next month with fastmoving consumer goods (FMCG) and grocery, followed by smartphones, televisions and home appliances.WILL SERVICE EVEN SMALL ORDERSReliance Retail will also be a seller on the platform with its owned and licensed brands such as John Players and may also develop a separate product line for B2B customers.  “However, the private brands sold through the Reliance Retail brick-and-mortar stores will not be available for B2B customers,” an executive said.Reliance Retail wants to tap an estimated 12 million kirana outlets, a majority of which source their products from traditional wholesale markets in the neighbourhood such as Sadar Bazaar in Delhi or distributors associated with large consumer companies.Modern wholesalers such Germany’s Metro AG, Walmart-owned Best Price, Reliance’s own network of cash-and-carry outlets called Reliance Market and others account for up to 10% of India’s overall wholesale market in some cities. The figure for FMCG products sold through organised wholesalers is lower at 3-4% of the total.The Reliance Retail platform will bring together large distributors and suppliers as well as small kiranas in a strategy the company has dubbed New Commerce, said one of the persons cited above. It will allow the servicing of orders of varying size, even small ones, through various modes.“Omni-channel will be one aspect of it,” he said. “For example, it will have large garment manufacturers from Tirupur selling 10-12 shirts to a kirana store.”Buyers can pick up goods from sellers’ premises or have them delivered through a robust supply network that Reliance is creating, he said. The company is building fulfillment centres and infrastructure for the supply of FMCG, grocery and consumer electronics, the executives said. Reliance did not respond to queries.HUGE MARKETThe size of the Indian wholesale market in food and grocery alone is about $600 billion.“Out of this, more than half is in the rural areas,” said Arvind Mediratta, managing director at Metro Cash & Carry India. “In tier-I urban cities — with more than 1million population and where modern wholesale is present — the share of modern wholesale would be close to 5%,” he said.In cities such as Bengaluru, where Metro operates six stores and in Hyderabad where it has four outlets, Metro Cash & Carry has a market share of 8-10%.“The bigger opportunity lies in B2B and serving the balance 90% of the market,” said an industry executive aware of the plans. “Reliance Retail wants to reach out to the smallest of kiranas and neighbourhood stores across categories through ecommerce.”Reliance Retail expects to maintain its high pace of growth by getting into B2B ecommerce since competition from large corporates is limited in the space, another executive said.“Reliance wants inclusive growth in ecommerce,” he said. “While consumerfacing ecommerce will happen, the company wants to digitally enable smaller stores to fight Amazon and Flipkart.”Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani unveiled the conglomerate’s plans for a “hybrid online-to-offline” venture in July 2018 that would take advantage of the synergies between Reliance Jio Infocomm and Reliance Retail’s stores. Ambani had said the company also seeks to leverage millions of kirana stores as last-mile delivery partners for its ecommerce initiatives.ET reported last year that Reliance is working on a multi-channel platform on which goods and services can be offered and purchased from anywhere through online and offline routes. While products will be delivered to the doorstep, customers will also have the option of picking up their purchases from Reliance’s network of stores or the outlets of its last-mile delivery partners."
"The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) on Friday approved higher tariff for Adani Power's 2,000 megawatt (MW) capacities at its Mundra power plant. The power plant was facing hardships after compensatory tariff was disallowed by the apex court in April 2017. Adani PowerNSE 5.45 % has been seeking to pass through higher cost of imported coal to run this plant. The cost of fuel rose after Indonesia changed its regulations. The Mundra plant in Gujarat is an imported coal-based plant.  ""The Commission in exercise its powers under Section 79 (1) (b) of the Act read with Article 18.1 of the PPAs (power purchase agreements) approves the Supplemental PPAs to Bid-01 PPA and Bid-02 PPA,"" the CERC said in an order.  Last year, power distribution firm Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd (GUVNL) had sought the CERC approval to amend terms of the PPA for 2,000 MW capacities with Adani's 4,620-MW Munda power plant.  In its plea to the CERC last year, GUVNL had proposed amendments to the two PPAs signed on February 6, 2007, and February 2, 2007, with Adani Power (Mundra) Ltd, for supply of contracted capacity of 1,000 MW each from units 1 to 4 and units 5 and 6 of Mundra power plant, respectively.  Disposing of the petition, the power regulator said said these projects (Adani and Tata's Mundra plants) are efficient, on super-critical technology and are base-load plants and therefore, it makes economic sense to keep them operationalised.  ""In sum, the supplemental PPAs entered into by the Petitioner and Respondent No.1 (GUVNL) in the light of the HPC (high-powered committee) recommendations and the Government of Gujarat order are in public interest designed to meet the long-term energy requirement of the consumers of Gujarat at a competitive price,"" it added.  The Gujarat government took a policy decision in December last year to give a package to rehabilitate the imported coal-based stressed power projects located in the state.  Based on decision, GUVNL and the generator had finalised the supplemental PPAs, which have been submitted for approval of the commission."

"PUNE: Praj IndustriesNSE -0.66 % announced today that it has signed a Construction License Agreement (CLA) with Gevo, Inc, USA dated 4th April 2019, to commercialize technology for the production of Isobutanol using sugary-based feedstocks, such as juice, syrup and molasses. Pursuant to the CLA, Praj will provide Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) services to 3rd parties using a process design package developed by Praj. This package uses Gevo’s proprietary Isobutanol biocatalyst on sugary-based feedstock. Isobutanol derived from said proprietary process is high energy renewable intermediate product that finds application in Aviation and Racing cars.To that effect, Praj also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Gevo Inc. to commercialize Gevo’s renewable hydrocarbons products. This includes Gevo’s renewable alcohol-to-jet fuel (“ATJ”) and renewable isooctane, derived from Gevo’s renewable Isobutanol. Pramod Chaudhari, Executive Chairman of Praj, said, “The addition of Isobutanol technology to Praj’s diverse product portfolio is a step in our endeavor towards smart biorefineries that facilitate sustainable decarbonization. This solution can be offered both as a ‘bolt-on’ to an existing ethanol plant or as a Greenfield plant. We value our partnership with Gevo and believe that this technology will help the aviation industry fulfill their obligation of Green House Gas (GHG) reduction. ” He added further that Praj will also pursue development of agri-biomass to Isobutanol as reinforcement of circular bio economy.“Praj is a company that shares our vision of the utilization of renewable resources and renewable energy to decarbonize transportation fuels,” said Patrick R. Gruber, Chief Executive Officer of Gevo. “With Gevo’s technology and Praj’s execution, ethanol can be substituted with isobutanol and drop-in gasoline. Gevo expects to leverage Praj’s Enfinity technology to produce second generation drop-in hydrocarbons utilizing Gevo’s existing technology that has already been proven. We expect to scale up quickly and be ready for the Indian market as early as 2020.”This CLA will allow Praj to leverage its extensive customer base to identify those interested in licensing Gevo’s technology to produce Isobutanol utilizing the Sugary-based Feedstock. The partnership with Praj provides Gevo with access to markets outside of North America such as India, Southeast Asia, Australia, South America and parts of Europe.In addition to the CLA, Praj and Gevo have also entered into a new Joint Development Agreement (JDA) dated 4th April 2019. This agreement is aimed at continuing joint development efforts to produce Isobutanol using agricultural residue such as bagasse, rice straw, wheat straw, corn stover, cotton stalk and empty fruit bunches. Both parties are nearing the completion of work to develop a process design package by using agricultural residue for production of Isobutanol. These 2nd generation agricultural residues are the lowest cost feedstocks in some markets and have the additional benefit of having a very low carbon footprint. According to the press release, Gevo is a next generation “low-carbon” fuel company focused on the development and commercialization of renewable alternatives to petroleum-based products. Low-carbon fuels reduce the carbon intensity, or the level of greenhouse gas emissions, compared to standard fossil-based fuels across their lifecycle. The most common low-carbon fuels are renewable fuels. Gevo is focused on the development and production of mainstream fuels like gasoline and jet fuel using renewable feedstocks that have the potential to lower greenhouse gas emissions at a meaningful scale and enhance agricultural production, including food and other related products. In addition to serving the low-carbon fuel markets, through Gevo’s technology, Gevo can also serve markets to produce chemical intermediate products for solvents, plastics, and building block chemicals.

"MUMBAI: Bharti AirtelNSE -1.27 % has confirmed that it has received in-principal approval from the telecom department for merger with Tata TeleservicesNSE 1.64 % (TTSL), provided certain conditions are met .“... the current in-principle approval of the DoT is subject to fulfilment of conditions ....with respect to the final approval of DoT involving certain actions and compliances to be undertaken. Only after completion of the actions and submissions of the compliances, the final approval is issued...” said the telco in a regulatory statement on Friday .ET had reported in its Friday’s edition that the conditions here are the bank guarantees of about Rs 9000 crore that the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has asked Airtel to provide to get the merger completed . However there is a very strong possibility of Sunil Mittal led Airtel will be contesting these guarantees. “...such matters, being sub-judice, may be challenged before the sectoral appellate authority/courts and disclosing such pre-mature matters may affect the market prices inappropriately,” added the operator .Airtel and TTSL had announced the deal in September 2017. As per the agreement -Airtel will take in the Tata Group-owned telco’s consumer mobile operations in 19 telecom circles – 17 under TTSL and two under TTML.For Airtel, the merger will bring in an additional 178.5 MHz of spectrum in three bands that are widely used for 4G, an area in which the Mittal-led company is expanding to keep pace with RelianceNSE -0.27 % Jio Infocomm. It will add about 18 million of Tata Tele’s mobile subscribers to its over 340 million users, according to regulatory data at the end of January.The deal will allow the Tata Group to rid itself of the loss-making mobility business, which has been a drag on the group’s finances."
"MUMBAI: After partnering with storied brick-and-mortar names such as Larsen & Toubro and Bharti, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) is looking to back emerging champions across financial services, healthcare, commerce and education that are overlaying technology to define and determine fast-changing consumer habits.The confluence of rising aspirations and spending power, undergirded by cheap data and information, is throwing up new investment opportunities such as Byju’s as one of the world’s biggest pension plans to tap fast-growing pockets for greater returns. The fund is seeking to allocate a third of its corpus to the emerging markets of China, India, Brazil and pockets of South East Asia in the next six years.“India currently is 2% of our portfolio. We do not want to box ourselves in with specific targets, but as our fund sizes grow, India will continuously see more deployment and outlay,” said Alain Carrier, CPPIB’s head of international operations. “In emerging markets such as India, we prefer partnering with a local player or backing the right management team. This will continue to be a dominant theme, though we may make a few exceptions.”Compared with China, Carrier sees India as far more receptive toward foreign capital. The $351-billion fund (as on FY18), for example, has stayed away from investing in Chinese infrastructure. On the flip side, however, hunt for the best partner, depth of the market to absorb large capital, and valuations are drawbacks unique to India, Carrier believes.Over the past decade, CPPIB has invested C$8.2 billion in India (as of December 31, 2018) with a focus on infrastructure, real estate and financial services, as well as co-investments alongside CPPIB fund partners, and other public holdings. Asia is the second-most important market for CPPIB with $72.5 billion (20.4%) of assets under management, as of March 2018.Much like its peers from Canadian pension funds, CPPIB is known for being a proponent of “direct” investments, where it bypasses intermediaries to make deals or buyouts. In India, too, it is open to taking larger bets, some even in existing portfolio companies such as Renew, the Goldman Sachs-backed clean energy platform, where it already has a minority stake.Explaining the investment thesis in India, Vikram Gandhi, an adviser to the fund, said that broadly it can be categorised into two – growth and yield generating. While bets on Kotak Mahindra, its largest in India so far, and Byju’s would be centred around the first goal, those focused on real estate or infrastructure assets such as roads and malls would largely leverage steady annuity or rent incomes.“Long-term pension capital should be seeking out assets with less volatility and greenfield risks,” said Gandhi.As the head of infrastructure investments, Carrier was instrumental in CPPIB’s first investment in India’s infrastructure sector, putting $332 million to work in Larsen & Toubro Infrastructure Development Projects Limited, which owns the largest toll-road concession portfolio in India."
"BENGALURU: Germany-headquartered B2B wholesaler Metro Cash & Carry has postponed the launch of its proposed kirana ecommerce plan to July. An e-kirana system for B2B customers, modelled on the lines of Amazon and Alibaba, was announced by the company in the third quarter last year. Arvind Mediratta, managing director at Metro Cash & Carry India, attributed the delay to the “peculiarities of the B2B trade compared with B2C business.”“E-kirana will be implemented in July this year. It is not delayed because of technical issues but due to the nature of the B2B business,” said Mediratta. He admitted that ecommerce is not easy to do in the wholesale business.“Unlike B2C customers, we are dealing with traders and businessmen. We are faced with challenges like customer-specific pricing, negotiating deals, online-offline pricing, and supervising portion-stock for walk-ins and ecommerce customers. We cannot state a fixed-price policy with traders who traditionally like to crack the best deal,” said Mediratta.Metro AG, the world’s fourth-largest retailer, entered India nearly two decades ago but doesn’t sell products directly to consumers in India. It is an organised wholesaler that sells products through a membership model to kiranas, local stores, hotels and catering companies with valid licenses.Currently, a sales force of 800 people has been deployed with tablets to meet kirana owners in real-time to negotiate deals, place digital orders and ease the USD 500 billion kirana market into tech-enabled shopping. “Once the suitable digital interface has been built, the human interface will be withdrawn,” Mediratta said.Metro, is the market leader in organised trade, with revenue of 776 million euros in the financial year ended September 2018, and competes with the world’s biggest retailer Walmart in the segment. With about 3 million members in the country, it has identified India as one of its “focus expansion countries” alongside Russia, China and Turkey and plans to take its store count to 50 by 2020 from 27 now. There are an estimated 10 million kirana stores in India and Metro said it will open compact stores to penetrate smaller towns."

"MUMBAI: Despite being the largest film industry in the world in terms of number of films produced every year, the Indian film industry lags behind the US and other countries in terms of revenues. The industry is poised to grow at 11% CAGR, reaching gross box office collection of Rs 23,800 crore ($3.7 billion) by 2020 from the current Rs 13,800 crore ($2.1 billion), according to a report by audit and consulting firm Deloitte. Released at the Indywood Film Carnival 2016 at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad on Sunday, the Deloitte Indywood report elaborates the current status of the Indian film industry, focus areas, challenges, and Make in India initiative relevance.  “Despite large number of films and theatre admissions, the industry continues to remain small with respect to other global industries in terms of revenue,” the report said. “In India, the film industry’s gross realisation stands at $2.1billion versus gross realisation of $11 billion in the US and Canada, which produces significantly lower number of films (approximately 700 films).”      The report highlights that India lags behind mainly due to “low ticket realisations and occupancy levels, lack of quality content and rampant piracy.” Low infrastructure penetration, slow growth in average ticket price (ATP), complicated tax regime, rising costs and lack of access to funding, multiple layers of bureaucracy and prevailing strict censorship norms are some other challenges. Deloitte also points out how lack in exhibition infrastructure is a key impediment.  “Addition of screens has not kept up with demand with increments of only 150-200 new screens per year. India is severely behind the globe in screen penetration — 6 per million versus 23 per million in China and 126 per million in the US,” it said. However, taking a positive outlook, the report also points out that expansion of multiplexes in smaller cities, investments by foreign studios in domestic and regional productions, growing popularity of niche movies, and emergence of digital and ancillary revenue streams will work as key growth drivers.  Further, increase in per capita income and growing middle class, growing demand from tier-II and III cities, diversification into international markets and more use of visual effects (VFX) in movies will drive up growth. The report said to achieve growth and profitability, the industry needs to focus on film tourism, skill enhancement, shortening window of release through better planning, updating current technology and countering piracy."
"BENGALURU: Online fashion retailer Myntra’s revenue during the two-day ‘End of Reason Sale’ earlier this month jumped 20 times, according to a top executive at the company.  “We have beaten the industry record, I don’t think anybody has done nearly Rs 100 crore of sale in one day,” said Prasad Kompalli, head of ecommerce at Myntra, which turned into a mobile app-only etailer last year.  Company executives said that in just two days, more than 1.5 million units were sold and Myntra acquired 200,000 new customers.  According to reports, the Bengaluru-based company had sold merchandise worth Rs 90 crore during its ‘End of Reason Sale’ last year. Myntra, refused to comment on their gross merchandise volume (GMV) or revenue numbers for the sale period.  The Flipkart-owned company is currently clocking GMV of over $500 million (about Rs 3,335 crore) annually, a growth rate of about 66% over the previous year. It is now targeting a GMV of $1 billion (Rs 6,670 crore) by May-June next year, one of the executives cited earlier said.  “We are not for discount-led growth. We are the only ones who have cracked big portion of the model to attract customers with differentiating value proposition,” said Kompalli.  Myntra recently launched a fashion network for brands and consumers on its mobile app in order to boost sales and consumer engagement as it inches towards profitability.  ""Our overall unit economics are getting closer and closer to profitability. The firm will break even in 2016,"" said Ananth Narayanan, CEO of Myntra had told ET in an interview earlier.  According to an April 2014 report by venture capital firm Accel Partners, Indians bought fashion products worth $559 million online in 2013 and the figure may increase to $2.8 billion by 2016. As per a PwC report, by 2020, online retail in India is expected to account for 3% of total retail. Further, orders per million are expected to more than double to 12 million by 2016 from five million in 2013."
"MUMBAI: National carrier Air India is expecting to increase annual revenue for 2016-17 by 9.7% to Rs 22,521 crore, minister of state for civil aviation Jayant Sinha said in reply to a query in the Lok Sabha today.  ""The main reason for this increase in revenues is an improvement in capacity utilization in terms of Revenue Passenger Kilometers (RPKMs) by 6.8% and an increase in Passenger Carriages by 6.2% when compared to the previous year 2015-16. The Passenger Load Factor is also expected to increase by 1.2% in absolute terms i.e. from 75.6% in 2015-16 to 76.4% in 2016-17,"" said Sinha. He added that an increase in utilization of the Boeing 777 plane which it deploys to the US and UK also helped.  The government has approved a turnaround plan (TAP)and a financial restructuring plan (FRP) for operational and financial turnaround of the airline. The TAP and FRP provides equity infusion of Rs 30,231 crore upto year 2021 subject to achievement of certain milestones.  Sinha said Air India has made ""substantial progress in both operational as well as financial areas as per TAP milestones.  It has initiated various cost-cutting strategies such as route rationalization of erstwhile Air India and Indian Airlines (which were merged in 2007), rationalization of certain loss making routes, phasing out of old fleet and consequential reduction in maintenance cost, joining global airline body Star Alliance, enhanced utilization of new fleet resulting in production of higher Available Seat Kilometers (ASKMs), closure of overseas offline offices at certain locations among other initiaves."
"KOLKATA: India’s top mobile carriers are likely to report a modest 6 per cent revenue growth over the next four years, stung by a sharp slide back in data and voice revenue growth amid rising competitive intensity fomented by tariff wars and Reliance Jio Infocomm’s disruptive pricing model, said analysts.  Data revenue growth rates have slowed from 70 per cent last year to 30 per cent now, and the forthcoming mega spectrum sale, they warned, would only make matters worse for incumbent carriers and cause more balance sheet pain.  Jio’s data-centric packages with unlimited voice, they said, have already started a bruising tariff war, especially since the Mukesh Ambani-led 4G entrant’s rates will be at ""a 35 per cent discount to incumbents,"" postfree offer.  Small wonder, Morgan Stanley has sharply lowered the industry’s data revenue (growth) estimate from 40 per cent to 26 per cent CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) during F16-20, and also halved estimated voice revenues to 1 per cent (CAGR) during the same period.  Jio’s pre-launch free offers, they said, have already enabled it to garner 20 per cent data volume market share leading to a data tariff war among incumbents and a slowdown in overall data revenues for the sector, said the US brokerage.  Analysts expect lower data growth to translate in top telcos reporting lower Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation & amortization) over the next three years.  Morgan Stanley, for instance, has cut third-largest operator, Idea Cellular’s Ebitda estimates in F17/F18/F19 by 6 per cent, 11 per cent and 9 per cent respectively, while the impact on this count is a tad less for market leader, Bharti AirtelNSE -1.27 %. The brokerage estimates Airtel’s Ebitda for F18/F19 to be only 3 per cent lower, saying it is ""best positioned"" to respond to competition from Jio, by virtue of its 23 per cent spectrum market, which is the highest among incumbent operators.  Lower data growth is slated to deal a body blow to fourth-largest carrier, Reliance Communications (RCom) on this metric, with the brokerage cutting its Ebitda estimates for F17 and F18 by 16 per cent and 18 per cent respectively.  According to Morgan Stanley, RCom’s core Ebitda has been under pressure with the loss of the 900 Mhz spectrum in five circles and migration of its CDMA customers to a 4G network. It expects the Anil Ambani-led company to potentially post losses during F2017 hit by high interest and depreciation & amortization (D&A) costs.  Analysts expect the upcoming multi-band spectrum auction, starting October 1, to further dent incumbent carriers’ balance sheets, especially once they recognize the full spectrum purchase liability. This, they said, would lead to a higher `net debt to Ebitda’, a key indicator of a stretched balance sheet. Goldman Sachs expects Idea’s ""net debt/Ebitda"" to rise to 3.8x in F17 from 3x in F16 based on the No 3 carrier potentially taking on an additional ""$2 billion of spectrum debt"" based on fresh airwave purchases in the next auction.  International brokerages, however, expect Airtel’s net debt/Ebitda to stay comparatively lower at 2.4-to-2.5x as they expect India’s No 1 mobile carrier to spend well under $1 billion in new spectrum purchases next month.  ""We also expect Bharti’s net debt/Ebitda to stay around 2.5x through F17-18 despite participation in the spectrum auction, given that it continues to de-lever in Africa, having already announced sale of assets worth $3.25 billion in the last 24 months,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients."
"KOLKATA: ITCNSE 3.15 % Ltd's newer FMCG business, which includes packaged food, personal care and education stationary products, crossed the Rs 10,000 crore revenue milestone in 2016-17 with sales growing by 8% to Rs 10,511.83 crore.  The company's fourth quarter earnings released on Friday said ITC is one of the fastest growing branded packaged foods businesses in the country. While the FMCG businesses were severely impacted in October-December quarter due to demonetisation, ITC said most categories recovered progressively after severe disruption in operation in the initial period of the cash crunch. However, the lifestyle retailing, education and stationery products businesses felt the headwinds longer.  The profitability of the newer FMCG businesses during the year was impacted declining by 72% at Rs 28.12 crore which ITC attributed to sharp increase in input prices during the year, gestation costs of new categories such as juices, dairy, chocolate and coffee and disruption in sales momentum due to the cash crunch. The company said the demand in the packaged foods industry remained sluggish during the year, with consumers curbing discretionary spending and rural demand remaining tepid.  The much anticipated pick-up in consumption expenditure on the back of good monsoons in 2016, low inflation and implementation of the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission did not play out fully. The incipient recovery in demand witnessed around the middle of the year was adversely impacted by the cash crunch especially during the third quarter. Further, the industry had to contend with sharp escalation in the cost of major commodities in the midst of heightened competitive intensity, leading to compression in margins,” ITC said in its release.  The company said it had commissioned three company-owned units in last fiscal to cater to the requirements of the packaged foods and personal care products businesses. It is currently developing over 20 more such integrated facilities in various stages of development.  The popular brands in the newer FMCG businesses include Aashirvaad atta, Bingo! snacks, YiPPee! noodles, Sunfeast Mom's Magic cookies, B Natural juices, and personal care products under Fiama, Vivel, Engage, and Savlon brands."
